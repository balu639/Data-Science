The nausea gets to me even with the meds . I have found alot of helpful tips from others on the boards . I have absolutely no taste for anything , so I try things to see if it will work for me . I find that chicken noddle soup tastes good after I take the first bite . I ca n't drink water ; it makes me gag .

6,TRUE,Just diagnosed late November . Stage I and with good prognosis . I had my lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy on Friday -LRB- Dec 4 -RRB- . The initial prelims with the node were good and I am just waiting on the path reports now . I am amazed at how much this consumes my thoughts even though I feel positive about my diagnoses . I am so thankful for a place like this to come and express my thoughts and feelings . I am 38 and also have extremely bad endometriosis and since my cancer is hormone + I can no longer take my LoEstrin which was keeping the endo somewhat in check . I have only been off the hormones about two weeks and am already experiencing pelvic pain . Now I am having to consider a hysterectomy and am really scared and do n't know what to do . I have no children and do n't really think I want to . I really want to do what is best for me but it is so hard to know . Anyone else been in the same boat with the endometriosis ?
0,TRUE,"swimangel172 , With regard to my comments I did not mean to imply that Arimidex causes any heart complications but that Tamoxifen is meant to give some protection as it allows some oestrogen to continue circulating and this is why it also less likely than Arimidex to cause bone loss . I feel that being on Tamoxifen is between a rock and a hard place and am well aware of the se 's of both medicines . I tolerate Tamoxifen extremely well and am afraid that Arimidex may lead to joint pains etc. but that may be the road I take . With regard to your comments about endometrial cancer I understand that if you are monitored it should be apparent long before developing into full blown cancer that things are going wrong . I also have read -LRB- do n't know where -RRB- that the incidence of endometrial cancer from taking Tamoxifen is very small , maybe as low as 1 - 3 % . In fact if you develop endometrial cancer within 2 years of taking Tamoxifen it generally means that it was there before the breast cancer diagnosis - Jaydee . "
0,TRUE,"EastCoast Girl : I did the CMF with tissue expanders . My PS said that it was not a problem to keep them in for up to a year + -LSB- had my BMX April 14 -RSB- .

With respects to the steroids during IV treatments , I did half of the dose . I was still a bit restless a few days after , but I felt it helped me with the nausea and SE . CMF was a longer road for me -LSB- 6 cycles total ; 2 weeks on/off , oral cytoxan pills 14 days , IV days 1 and 8 -RSB- but it was definitely worth it . "
2,TRUE,"So I met with the Oncologist yesterday and it was very enlightening . She said the Oncotype test was really designed for lymph node negative cases , though it can help shed light on others as well . When asked about the opinion of my sugeon that chemo would not help my cancer -LRB- because my 16 low score -RRB- , she said that in the Oncotype study they used only AC chemo on the patients , therefore it had no benefit . Had they used other chemo like TC , it may have had benefit . So that changed the whole picture for me . It also pissed me off that the Oncotype folks did not fully disclose this . Their stats do n't necessarily mean that ANY chemo would not benefit low score women , just that the AC chemo did not benefit them . My Oncologist said that in my situation she felt I would reduce the risk of recurrence by 35-40 % by having chemo . For me , with those odds , there is no decision . I am scheduled to begin TC on June 11 . Of course now it is all about the HAIR . I was fully prepared to accept complete hair loss -LRB- already started digging out scarves -RRB- , now I see these postings about Penguin cold caps preventing hair loss . I am SOOOOO tired of all this research and decision making ! "
2,FALSE,"And this is why I post here ... because it is where other women understand , have compassion and give good advice . Thanks ladies !!! I 'm slowly pulling myself away from the dark side but not quite there yet . Had a horrible bout of the trots two nights ago and ended up taking three Immodium AD 's . Not sure if it is from the Abraxane -LRB- last treatment 12/17 -RRB- or just a bug . Fun times .

6,TRUE,Hi Dianne - I am glad I found your post as I am sort of in the same boat . I did not have chemo but ca n't take tamox . anymore . It is a big decision whether to do ooph or shot . I am 51 and premenopausal . I did not have to do chemo as I had an early stage and had a BMX so no rads . Hopefully more woman will let us know their experiences !

0,TRUE,"Hey , ladies , it is Weesa back again about my AI experience . And , I was asked about my chemo -- I did dd ACT after mastectomy , rads then the AI 's . There is a clinical trial going on , a double blind trial where half the survivors are given a placebo and half are given Femara for another five years beyond whatever they took for the first five years -- Tamoxifen or AI . The trial is several years out -- I know this because my onc asked me to join the trial several years ago . I declined because I did n't think I could commit to ten years , and I was right -- I only lasted for 6.5 years . It is anticipated the difference between five years and ten is only going to be a percent or two . I have had a long rough road convincing people in my health care circle that I was n't crazy , that I was n't imagining my se 's . Without saying so directly to me I could see they thought of me as a total nut case a few years ago , and I feel so vindicated now , reading about so many se 's -- there is such a striking similarity in our experiences . I still urge anybody needing to take an AI who is highly hormone receptive as I was -- to go ahead . They really do work -- and I am not excluding Tam here either which I could not take due to my port clotting up . The figures are impressive . But you will pay a price -- it 's no different than any other good thing in life . If you listen to your body you will learn what to do -- I took glucoasmine chrondroitin , Mobic , turmeric , never sat for more than ten minutes without getting up and walking , swimming , hot tub , special massages , acupuncture , you name it , but it all helped me for a good long time.When my knees started popping out of joint when I drove my car and I had to hold them in place with my hands and manage to steer the car , and then my left knee tore so I felt it -- I knew it was time to quit , and you will know also when that time is.I think what bothers so many of us is that sometimes it seems to be a conspiracy of silence with the oncs and the drug reps.I was told so often it was just a concidence that my body chose the time to start ripping apart as the same time as taking an AI . But trust your instincts , if you feel it is an se it probably is . You know your body better than anybody else . When I was a young woman I fell into the trap of taking birth control pills for a good many years , then when I got married and could n't conceive I took Clomid , then when I was 50 or so a male gyn talked me into HRT against my better judgment.For the past years I was still screwing with my hormones -- it was time to quit . Let 's hear from some more really older but wiser women -- I am 66 . almost 67 . "
0,TRUE,"I was given a choice for the mastering , if I choose this I would not need radiation treatments . Or I could go with breast conservation , which would be a lumpectomy w/removal of 3 `` sentinel lymph nodes '' which I would had to have then follow up with radiation + hormone blockers . I choose the Breast Conservation . My surgery was Sept. 3rd .2009 m Ever thing went apparently well . I was happy to hear I had all negative nodes . I felt really good within a short time . I returned to my Doctor a week after surgery for my follow up and was very encouraged and my spirits we high . WELL , WHAT A WAMMY I RECEIVED !!!!! After careful dissection of the 3 nodes they in fact found another 3mm mass which was positive . So , I was rescheduled for another surgery Sept. 17th for a complete `` Axillary Dissection '' . This was so hard on me . I cried a lot . But , as difficult as it was I made it through . I 'm a good bit more tender because of the incision is right under the arm . Very sensitive area !!! And the drain surely is no joy . I am dealing with it well though . And , even though my Doctor said they would prescribe + suggest I would need 6 weeks off of work , I returned to work 3 days later . I did OK . I have an office job and I 'm pretty much alone , so dealing with the drain was not a problem either NOW , I RECIEVED MORE NEWS !!!!!!!! I had one more positive -LRB- 6mm -RRB- node . If I had n't had any bad nodes , I would had to only do radiation , but because of the new findings , even if was just the one positive node , this will mean of course I do need Chemo therapy also . I seen my hemotologist yesterday and he said more than likely I 'll have the chemo first -LRB- about 3 weeks from now -RRB- , I need to heal a bit more first . Then I 'll have the radiation and I will still of course be doing the blockers for the hormones . Ny hemotoligist is meeting with the Radiology along with my surgeon before the exact type of meds are prescribed to me . I will have some choices , and I know at this point because my cancer is so very invasive , I will want just as an aggressive therapy . I 'm too scared not to DO still feel blessed in that after my MRI , which showed another area of concern on my other breast , the right side I had a biopsy and Thank You Sweet Jesus it was negative I 'm happy just to have one good working arm !!! Yet , because , I want to see my grandchildren grow . I want to be there when my granddaughter walks down that isle ... ... ... ... I WILL FIGHT !!!

6,TRUE,"By all means get a second opinion and be sure to find out how much of a benefit it will give you ; if it 's substancial do n't be afraid to have chemo . Is is NOT fun , but for most people very doable ; and if it gives you a much better chance of never having to do this again , it 's well worth the effort . I was in the same boat as you , my surgeon just mentioned a mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiation ; and since my lymph nodes were clear , I was totally SHOCKED when the oncologist recommended chemo ; but after seeing the numbers , I knew I had to do it & am glad that I did . I wonder if surgeons just do n't want to freak you out more than you already are , or if they do n't think about anything other than surgery ; but I 've had several friends who have had this happen to also .

6,FALSE,"danismom - the wait is the absolute worst part . I also did n't discuss bc with anyone for a long time . The lump was found 12/26 and did n't tell anyone until just before my appointment with the surgeon on 2 / 25 , the day before my biopsy . Then I only told my dh . And I waited for what seemed like forever . I had surgery on 3/24 and started chemo on 4/24 . The months , I still feel was too long . I just wanted to get it over . STill feel that way . I thought I was good with all of the treatments until the week before I started chemo . I was a nervous wreck . I snapped at everyone , especially people trying to be nice , I could n't concentrate , I could n't sleep . When I went for the first tx , I felt calm . I had no problems during the infusion , and my nurse is great . I met with her when I had the first onc . appointment and she went over side effects , meds I take , etc. . The day of the first infusion , she explained everything in detail - what I was getting , what it was for , what to expect . I felt calm . Dh and I played cards most of the time . He beat for a change - I still blame it on the benadryl . I was there the first time for about 5 hours , with the infusion lasting about 4 . I did n't have many side effects , but I had read what others and said , so I tried to stay ahead of them - I began with a stool softener that night , etc. . I was more at ease with the second , but still somewhat nervous , as I expect I will be each time . I told the nurse that I had no problems the first time and I would like to go slow again . They usually do the taxotere a bit faster the second time . She said sure . Today is day 4 and so far only a bit of bone pain last night -LRB- could be taxotere or neulasta -RRB- and that 's it . Remember that you can be in control of part of this - take your meds , drink lots , rest , do something you enjoy that puts this in another part of your mind . That 's the hard part .

I decided to have a MRI to help further evaluate my other breast . Well , MRI suggested 2 invasive cancers , 1 ea breast so went for dbl mast w/out a second thought . Luckily the MRI was wrong and only had a lot of precancerous tissue in both . I do n't regret my decision at all because the way I see it if I had waited on the left , who knows at what stage the cancer would be before it was found . I had expanders put in at the same time and had my exchange to silicone implants in Oct. . It was a long process , uncomfortable at times but very manageable . I had my nipple reconstruct in Nov. and going for my tattoos next month - thinking of some neat flowers instead . I figure after all I 've been through why not , they 're never going to be real any way . I 'm now having fun shopping for clothes that accentuate my new girls . They look pretty da ** good .

I put an item in the weekly paper and on the local tv channel . ??? How did I end up running the team ??? I was just innocently sitting at my Herceptin infusion last week and this Relay lady dropped off the info for me to bring back to town and give to the lady who captained the event last year .

Some of the stores are still closed and I wanted to go to Best Buy to check on a G.P.S. but they wont be open for 2 more wks . I think you could get a good price on a dinged car . They said on the news some of the repair shops are destroyed and there are sooo many cars needing repaired . Some of the car dealers got tore up . Gee it is amazing what wind can do . We were camping one time with 2 of our kids and got hit by a tornado and it rocked us in our camper . It was pretty scary and I never want to be in one again . I woke at 2 a.m. because it was so quiet . I could n't hear the frogs or crickets and then I heard a train getting louder and louder and then it threw us around . When we got out the giant trees looked like x-mas trees from all the clutter in the tops of them . We sold the camper . The back pain is really getting bad . I think I am going to have to take the pain pills a little more often . Tylenol is n't working anymore . My fingers are bad too . My scalp gets tender on top like when my hair fell out on A/C .

You must have been relieved not to be carted away from the fundraiser in an ambulance , and I 'm sure the fresh air on your drive did you a world of good . I agree completely with your take on expressing concern to people . I adjusted my approach some years ago when my brother died . I had always reached out to close friends , but someone I worked with or did n't know well , I would probably not approach for not wanting to say the wrong thing . Well , when friends and acquaintances were offering me support , I realized that I so appreciated the act of someone approaching me in any way , regardless of what they said or if they fumbled . Since then , I have always come forward to offer support , and then I base any followup conversations or actions on how the person responds . I think just the acknowledgement is important , rather than acting like the most important thing that 's going on in someone 's life is n't worthy of conversation . I know `` is n't worthy '' is n't the right way to explain it , but that 's how it can seem . On the flip side , I remember being very concerned about someone , but not wanting to intrude , so I try to remember that some people in my life must feel that way about me , and I just try not to take any reaction personally .

Now I am just a few quarters from graduating and I am so happy that I decided to just live my life as though I have all the time in the world . Now instead of wondering if I was wasting valuable time with my family , I think , `` Wow ! look at all the valuable time I did not waste '' . All of this said of course is not going to help you much since you are right in the middle of treatments and your thought processes right now are what you have to go through , and process , in order to get to where I and other find ourselves after you arrive at the end of the road on your journey .

The bc.org interpretation was that compression garments were NOT needed for flying , but closer reading showed that some women flew to Australia from Canada , and some took a short flight , and some women DID develop LE . Otter did a great summary of it , I agree that Dr. Schmidtz does say to work up slowly , and her PALS trial will be in the NE Journal soon , and it was women with LE who worked with trainers . I 'm eargerly awaiting the article . But there is this trend to tell us to try anything : the same ask the expert had a woman with ALND and radiation to the nodes ask if it was safte to to do yoga abd they said YES . Mei Fu Phd cautions against downward dog . And that person has a 50 % chance of LE , so I 'd rather they said , try it with well fitting compression , and only briefly at first .

I am hopeful , as with my plastic surgeon , that down the road , if my armpit has not sustained too much damage from the radiation I would undergo the trans flap reconstruction . I am with you , the oncologist has indicated that radiation is not necessary but all he had to say was that if I was his wife or daughter and knowing the benefits vs the risks , he would recommend the radiation .

0,TRUE,"In answer to your question about having a double mastectomy the first round instead of waiting down the road and doing it later-both yes and no . I sometimes think that it would have been better to have them both done at one time . However , when I was diagnosed with breast cancer , I was so overwhelmed and was originally contemplating bet a lumpectomy and mastectomy . My head was all over the place . So , having the prophylactic later made me know that I was absolutely making the best decision for me . I was able to carefully think about the pros and cons of it and make a good choice for me . I did n't feel `` rushed into '' making a choice because I had to have surgery on my cancerous breast . Also , I believe the recovery process was probably a bit easier than doing them at the same time . The drawback is having an additional surgery , but I was in a much better place the second time around . "

The road through surgery and treatment is a whole lot easier with a little help from our friends . I have `` sisters '' I have met since being diagnosed who I consider my friends and the family I choose for myself , especially as my biological family were not supportive . Good luck with your appointment on Monday . "
0,TRUE,yes - thank you melissa and tami - i think this will be a very popular forum - i was dx with ILC in october of 04 - it was a small -LRB- 0.9 cm -RRB- tumor with negative nodes - i did not need chemo - had my 33 weeks of radiation and started on arimidex - my biggest concern was either ILC showing up in the other breast or as my oncologist kept suggesting DCIS - sure enough just as i was getting ready to start my paramedic studies my mammo showed a suspicious area in my other breast - i had a steriotactic needle biopsy and my radiologist - who found my ILC a year ago and pushed for the biopsy even though the surgeon did not think it was warranted - told me it looked fine and i only had to worry if i heard her voice on the phone in two days and not one of the receptionists - so needless to say when i answered the phone and it was her - i knew it was bad news - DCIS - very small but back to the surgeon i went - they both agreed another lumpectomy would be the best plan so i agreed - post-op the doctor told me it was the healthiest breast tissue he had ever taken out - that the DCIS was so microscopically small that it was a miracle my radiologist saw it - -LRB- i always considered her my miracle anyway so this just reinforced it -RRB- 33 more weeks of radiation and back on the arimidex - so - a long - painful road but i feel very lucky - they never mentioned a mastectomy - they were both very pro breast sparing surgery and i trusted their opinion then and still do -
2,TRUE,"Hi , I am starting rads on 12/29 ! Thought I might need chemo first but just got my second opinion today and it is no chemo for me ! -LRB- what a relief -RRB- .

This will be difficult in light of the fact that I work outside the home and it will be awkward to not wear a bra , but ... ok ! "
0,TRUE,"Hi Deborah , I 'm sorry to hear of your current findings on ultrasound , as well as your history in the past of breast cancer . Beesie answered you well , echogenic findings on breast ultrasound can be benign or not benign , and we 're hoping this is nothing too . What is the next step for you Deborah ? Is the radiologist scheduling you for a core biopsy , where they numb the skin and use a special tool to take `` cores '' from what is showing as a dark finding on US ? Usually we advocate for women to proceed with the biopsy , as it 's only under the microscope that the pathologist can finalize a diagnosis . I 'm sure this prospect is scary , having been down this road once before , yet the test is relatively simple and then would give you the ability to go to the next step , if any is even needed . Please do n't let too long a period of time go by with watching this without a biopsy . If fear is a factor here , well , we understand how it can paralyze any of us . So we 're here for you , to talk , and listen and urge , and hold your hand . Anything we need to do , to help you take care of you . Please let us know your next step will be , should you wish . I 'll be thinking of you in the meantime , keeping good thoughts going your way . Tender "
6,TRUE,"My head is spinning from all the information about what is good for us and not good for us . I too have cut back on wine fearing recurrence . I have changed my diet . I am trying to reduce stress . I joined a yoga group . I have dense breast tissue , never had a full pregnancy and took HRT for about 12 years following a total hyst at 35 . So which ones contributed to BC . I think I am now on information overload . I have recently purchased 4 books to read about breast cancer . It 's a never ending vicious circle for me ... I need to get off and take a break . Anyone else in this boat ????? "
4,TRUE,"Hi , I 'm a 5 year survivor but not in a great space these days . I made a decision to have a bilat mast due to family history , 1 lymph node involved so due to history I had very aggressive , dose dense chemo . That ended in June of 05 - got it out of the way and went every other week , cut the time in half . Later , I had implants put in -LRB- replaced expanders -RRB- . They did not agree with me . I 'm one of those unlucky ones that contracted auto immune disorder and I kept getting infections in the left breast , last one was bad so the PS finally decided to remove both of my implants . That was Feb. of this year , I have not been the same since . My partner of 15 years thinks its time to move on , however its not so easy . I 'm wondering if I made the right decision , which I DID make becuase I am with a woman so thought it would be easier , was in a long term relationship and just felt o.k. , that was then this is now . NOW , regarless of my sexual preference , my womanhood if you will is just ruined . Intamacy ? Not ! To add insult to injury , when I just wrapped up chemo and before my implants , my partner had an affair with a friend of ours . Even though that was in 2006 I 'm still impacted by that as well . I am not the same person I used to be and do n't know if I can ever find myself again . I 'm very angry , very sad , very upset and just a whole host of `` stuff '' stirring up inside . I 'm glad I found this board , there is actually something available where I can express what I am going through and not apoligize for it . The proverbial pink cloud just is n't where I am , today anyway . Maybe one day I 'll get there but until then this ride sucks !!!!! "

This year is better - although stage IV , I 'm stable , back to work , and feeling pretty good all things considered . I really do n't want to turn into one of those folks who gets all mopey over Christmas , but it 's so hard not to think of it as the first anniversary of my breast cancer diagnosis .

4,TRUE,"Hi , I have learned much after the fact , that Vitamin B-12 helps prevent and lessen neuropathy . I had both feet and hands neuropathy pretty bad after the four runs of Taxol . Was tripping a lot , could n't walk fast , even was using a cane on uneven ground , dropped a lot of dishes , etc. . I also did four months of acupuncture about 4 months post-chemo -LRB- as soon as I heard about it helping -RRB- which took over half of it away , woo hoo ! Now I take Vitamin B-12 1000 mcg . sublingual tablets , the kind that melts under your tongue , two or three times a day . I had tried Vit . B-12 shots every 3-4 weeks , but they wore off , so the effect kept changing , which I 'd get both better and worse in the 3-4 weeks , sort of a roller coaster ride . With the daily doses of B-12 , I do so much better . I have met women whose treatment included a shot of B-12 with each Taxol treatment , and they all reported no neuropathy , wish I 'd known ... oh well , it really does help a lot to take it now . Now I walk , can run , bounce on a trampoline , keep up with my 10-year old , walk on the beach , and drop a lot fewer dishes now ! Good luck !! I wish you all the best . Cynthia "

0,TRUE,"I had my first fill on 1-14 . It was pretty uneventful . I have a mentor tissue expander in place , filled with 200cc at the time of the mastectomy . The fill process went like this for me . I am in a wrap around gown , in a reclining chair . The PS uses a magnetic locater to find the port area on the breast , which he marks with a purple pen . He then filled a syringe with 100cc of sterile saline fluid that is attached to tubing with vents to aid in the filling of the tissue expander . He did tell me that I would feel a little prick as he put the needle in , I really would say since my breast has numbness I really did n't feel the needle much . I did feel the fluid pressure as the fluid went in , not painful but pressure . The process took about 5 minutes , he removed the needle and put a dot size band aid on the area . It was no biggie at the time . I was concerned about pain since I had fluid buildup from having the drain taken out the Friday before . I had my drain in for 12 days , and was still draining 60cc per day , so that was another issue . The feeling of pressure and muscle spasms are the biggest annoyance . The worst time for me with the fill and my tissue expander is in lying down and trying to get comfortable . If I did n't have my U shaped micro bead neck pillow , I would be very cranky , it is the one device that helps me get comfortable . My husband bought it for my a year ago at the airport as a gift , I thought I do n't want to lug this around when he bought it for me , but I did n't tell him that .

0,TRUE,"I do think that different feelings tend to be evoked by pink ribbons in those of us with stage IV than those with earlier stage cancers .

If I had not been stage IV from the start but rather dx ` ed with an earlier stage and `` cured '' -LRB- although I disagree that there is such a thing as a cure -- merely excisions and treatments that can delay recurrence long enough to die of something else -RRB- , I suppose I might get warm fuzzy feelings when I see a pink ribbon . Since I was not afforded the opportunity to feel like I was ever free & clear of bc once I was diagnosed , the prissy pinking of so many products just angers me because I bought the whole `` cure '' and `` bump in the road '' mentality that it represents .

I had exit burns on my neck and back and open , oozing raw blisters from the neck to belly in front and under my arms and down my sides for 3 months !!! Burns were so bad that they had to stop radiation 1 treatmeant earlier than plan .

2,TRUE,"I had 2 mammograms , and one ultra sound that was clear and said I did n't have cancer . Then they ordered a needle biopsy of the lump under my arm , and the tissue came back with cancer cells . Because they ca n't find the tumor they ordered a Cat-Scan to check the chest , liver , stomach area , and a full body Bone-Scan , and found no cancer anywhere else in the body except the breast . The lump may be the tumor they said even though it is n't actually on the breast . I would think even though the cancer cells have not stuck anywhere and started a growth that they may be floating around getting ready to so the reason for the Chemo would be to kill any of those cells floating around . That is just my guess . They will also do on me radiation and targeted Herceptin treatment to the cancer cells in that lump , and finally a mastectomy . I have heard those bone biopsies are extremely painful so do n't think I would ask for one unless they seen it necessary . Absolute be your own health advocate in research to know what is going on with your body , but you have to rely on these OC that specializes in the cancer too . Hope this helps some . I know it is a difficult time . Just getting those test back yesterday seemed like a weight of tremendous magnitude was lifted off me .

2,TRUE,"Lali , It seems like a good choice by your oncologists to offer you Xeloda , in light of the PET demonstrated intramammary node . Guess this node is too deep to safely biopsy , those intramammary nodes sometimes presenting in such critical places . Studies have shown that even small doses of radiation can cause an increase in the essential enzyme necessary for the activation of the Xeloda , and even better , enhance Xeloda 's effect . So your doctor 's are right on the button with their advise . Xeloda can cause problems with diarrhea and a condition called hand foot syndrome . Here is a brief link to some explaination of this : http://www.fda.gov/Cder/consumerinfo/druginfo/Xeloda.HTM There 's been some phase III trial 's demonstrating benefit of adding Lapatinib to Xeloda -LRB- capecitabine -RRB- in women with prior Anthracycline and Taxane exposure . Perhaps you may wish to ask your oncologist about this . Sounds like you have a good oncology/radiation oncology team working with you .

On a lot of the boards , it seems like so many ladies eventually get their implants replaced with a flap further on down the road . I have gone back and forth so many times . Implants with alloderm sounds like a good option too and I seriously considered it . Honestly to have perky foobs and being able to go braless -LRB- with implants -RRB- sounds mighty appealing but my plastic surgeon is very good at the microsurgery involved for tram free flap so I felt fortunate to have that option so close to home and he felt I was a good candidate .

I had my surgery -LRB- mastectomy on right breast with tissue expander put in -RRB- Feb 27 . 5ξ1/2 weeks later my doctor gave me the ok to go biking and I think I started running at about 8 weeks . Not only did I get my fitness level back this year I even did better in some races this year compared to last year . I did n't get much pain when I had my fills that a lot of times I would stop on the way home from my doctors appointments at my friends house and we would go biking and running . This fall I even did 2 big adventure races . One was a 24 hour race the 1st weekend in Sept and the 2nd was a 36 hour race the last weekend in Sept. . I joked how I had to get all my activity in that weekend because I had my exchange surgery that following Wed Oct. 1st . Last weekend I got out for my 1st bike ride since my exchange but still going to wait a couple weeks before I start running . I 'm hoping to get out again this weekend .

I did n't have an overly hard experience during my treatment but at the same time it was n't exactly easy .

I have gone back to full-time and am doing well from a medical standpoint . That being said , I do experience these puzzling emotions you mention . I am extremely happy to have survived , to be alive and able to live and work full time . However , at the same time , I find that I am very quick to get angry and will jump off the handle and get angry over very small or very large issues . I actually had an argument in the grocery store because I was buying three cases of soda and bottled water . Last month I did n't put them all up on the belt and they got upset that they could n't scan each one .

At first I tried to explain that the last time it did n't work out that way so I was trying to do it right and put them all up there for the clerk . This manager said oh no , that 's not how it should be . She kept going on until I finally said , oh should I check to see who is the manager before I shop so I 'll know if I should do it your way or not ? I was really upset and angry .

2,TRUE,"Hi all you girls sceduled for September . I had my bm last September with expanders filled to 700cc . I had a lot of pressure but not much pain from the expanders . My issue has been the pain from the Mas . Apparently I have very sensitive nerves and the nerve pain has been an issue ever since my mas . I have been on pain killers for one year now . I just weaned myself off the oxycontin and now take a Percocet once in the morning and once at night . The doc feels that the implants are probably putting pressure on the re-generating nerves or that the nerves are imbedded in my scar tissue . Every doctor told me to wait for one year after my exchange surgery to see how I feel then . I do feel some relief as time goes on by still hurt some times . My exchange surgery was very painful at first but after a couple of days it was okay . I was out of work for one week . The surgery pain was gone by then , but the nerve pain has never gone away . My doctor told me that my silicone implants are a `` C '' but I am smaller than the C I was before . My foobs now spread across my chest rather than projecting like they did before . He told me that he used the most projected implants possible . I guess I will have to get used to being smaller . That really surprises me as he had put in so much for the fills - 700 cc . That is more than most get . I am doing great otherwise one year out from my mastectomy . There is a light at the end of the tunnel for all of you and I wish you all good luck and my prayers are with all of you . Life does get back to normal pretty much , at least mine has .

On September 14 , 2007 , breast cancer patients and it 's community loss a valiant fighter against breast cancer . Martin D. Abeloff , M.D. , 65 , died of leukemia . He was Chief Oncologist and Director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Johns Hopkins University . Dr. Abeloff 's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when he was twelve . His witness of her disfiguring radical mastectomy results , and lengthy , toxic treatments awakened in him a passion towards breast cancer research , resulting in groundbreakng work in breast cancer screening as a key prevention tool . Dr. Abeloff was known by his patient 's for an extraordinary kind bedside manner , non-rushed approach , which allayed many a breast cancer patient fears . He frequently providing them with his phone number for future questions or concerns . At a Hopkins event this year he was noted for saying , `` You simply ca n't treat cancer without paying attention to the psychological and social aspects of the disease '' . Early in his career , he noted the stigma of a cancer diagnosis , saying `` many patient 's felt guilty , as if it was their fault they had cancer . This blaming-the-patient mindset was common at the time , and added to the stigma of the disease '' . He credited activism and advocacy on the part of patient groups with helping to reign in such thinking . Dr. Abeloff , whose contributions to oncology are too many to list , was instrumental in facilitating Hopkin 's largest single donor gift , a $ 150 million dollar donation from Sidney Kimmel . During his 15 years of leadership at the Center , he went on to double the Kimmel Center 's number of faculty members , oversee a sixfold increase in research funding , and raise it 's ranking consistently to one of the nation 's top three cancer centers . A much beloved , dedicated cancer researcher and clinician died this week of cancer .

0,FALSE,"Boy is n't this fun , watching the snow fall . I need a Wally World fix . I go to walk to get exercise . I think we have 7 or 8 inches and it is still snowing .

They are n't even trying to clear the roads except the main ones in town and like I-55 because the white out conditions and drifting . I ca n't believe I live in this weather . Where is my mind ? Anyone seen it ? I think it went to chemo land . Later girls and hope you do n't get cold Janie . You know it is sooo much easier to get cool than warm . When you have to run like a panther to get from your car to inside because its sooo cold you need your head examined . This is just miserable and I say that like this has never happened here before , maybe it did n't bother me so much when I was younger , hmmmm , nope it did and I stayed , I must be nuts . Mary "
0,TRUE,"Just wrote a post that was deleted by accident . Frustrating and I do n't have chemo to blame . Here goes again . Re : lymphedema . I suffered 3rd degree burns and had skin grafts on my upper right arm and underarm about 10 years ago . Following surgeries I had physical therapy and wore acompression garmet consistenly for a year . I also lifted weights and had massage . I never had any problems with lympedema . Fast forward 10 years , I find a lump on the same side and have surgery with multiple lymph nodes removed . Chemo and 36 rad treatments . Needless to say I was concerned . I have been following same regime as before -LRB- no PT -RRB- but lifting light weights , and massage . No problems . I agree that no needle pricks , blood pressure of tight jewelry should be applied or worn on the affected arm . I feel sorry for those Sisters who have gone before and were told to baby their arm . Bold , in answer to your question re follow-up care . I see surgeon and rad onc every 3 months . See onc every 3 weeks after having bloodwork . I have a MUGA after every 2 herceptin treatments as my infraction rate was too low following chemo and I had to lay off for a month . I will finish Ca n't wait !!!! I am glad to hear that everyone in my posse is doing well ! to those of you going thru chemo ... hang in there . It will soon be a dim memory and you will be on the road to recovery . Lisa , are you coming up this way soon ? Maja "
0,FALSE,"I had skin grafts on my skin sparing mastectomy sites due to necrosis from paper tape allergy . Skin was `` shaved '' from my upper thigh ; still have a brownish place there -LRB- from July 2006 -RRB- but not too bad . Boob area does n't look great but better than raw ! Yeah , felt kinda like a road rash or burn . "
0,TRUE,"Hi - it 's like a century since I was going through chemo and on the boards . Started radio on 6th and developed cough three treatments in !! General physician and chief radiographer concerned - the latter even asked me if I wanted to stop ! Finding it very hard here in Hong Kong . Have had chest x-ray -LRB- clear - no infection so cough/throat hoarseness due to treatment -RRB- , and will see radiology oncologist Monday next armed with questions . As my cancer was removed in May , this is preventative . He has to reassure me the risks of possibly developing lung cancer down the road outweight the benefits of non-recurrence , or even be flexible to change the dosage and extend the regime , If not , second opinion required !! P.S. Pure vitamin E oil on breast overnight has kept any sking reactions away - so far . "
2,TRUE,I do n't know what a hot spot is but I do n't think this is cancer -- especially in light of the fact that you were just dx 'd with something else . And that is what this is . I 'm going to say a prayer for you anyway . At leasts the onc is being quick about it and getting you in tommorrow . So sorry you 're having to deal with this .
4,TRUE,"Just got the news today that I am going to need chemo as well as radiation because of the her2 . Next is an echo cardiogram and having a port put in and then meeting with oncologist again on March 17 . It looks like we will do taxol weekly for 12 weeks and then possibly cytoxan 4 x 2 . I will be doing herceptin for a year and probably Femara sine I am post menopausal . I am the nana to 7 grandkids and my batchelor son just got married on Feb 7 , It has been quite a ride . My annual mammogram found a spot . Had more mammograms , ultra sound and MRI and then excisional biopsy to remove . It was cancer and no clear margin . Did re-biopsy and sentinal lymph nodes 2 weeks later . Clean nodes but still not clean margins . 9 days later another re-biopsy this time margins clear . Thought we were just doing radiation until the her2 results came back . Now we are just taking it a day a a time . "
2,FALSE,"Lee - My CTA prior to my hip flap reconstruction also picked up some spots on my liver and on my kidney . My doctor re-ran the CT scan a couple of weeks ago and there are 7 simple cysts -LRB- all less than 1 cm -RRB- and a hemangioma which is between 9 and 12 mm . Both scan said it was hemangioma , but this second one is showing it as being larger , which is kind of unnerving . My onc said sometimes it is really dependent on where the CT slices the area as to how big it measures . Hang in there ! I still have to have another CT w/contrast again in 6 months - keeping my fingers crossed for benign results for you next week . As for the PET - they just turn the lights down and give you a blanket and have you try to relax . You will do fine ! "
2,FALSE,"I have had floaters for 17 years , since my detached retina , so I do n't worry about those . -LRB- I really told you not to worry about floaters ? I guess I was speaking from experience , but at least I was right . -RRB- I do n't expect they will ever go away . What made this different was that I was seeing flashes of light -LRB- which I 've also experienced several times over the years , just not contiuously -RRB- and the shower of floaters -LRB- already gone away -RRB- . I always have the squiggly lines . When my right eye went this time , I had a really dark , distracting floater , which I 've never had before . And with my left eye I had the shower of floaters , like dust pouring down from the ceiling . I expect that as I age this will happen more and more often . If I had a detached retina at the age of 29 , I am clearly strongly predisposed . What I will have to talk to my ophthalmologist about at the follow-up visit is how to manage this -- when should I go in ? Now that I 've been through this experience I think I will be less likely to think it is eye mets in the future , but I do have to protect my vision . I was so focused on cancer that I missed the most important concern , a retinal tear . So I 'm older and wiser . Its the older part I have to get used to . "
0,TRUE,"Sue , Thanks for searching me out . I just finished catching up on your thread . You have been on quite the roller coaster ride . After a rough couple days at home -LRB- I could n't even feed myself my arm hurt so had and was so swollen -RRB- I think I have finally turned the corner and am starting to feel better . I was pretty drugged up for a while . I got my drains out today , what a relief that was . I have fluid in my lungs and have been coughing quite a bit , which is really painful on the incisions from the hysterectomy . And go figure , I did 5 months of chemo , and never once threw up , but I was SO nauseated and threw up from the pain meds . Yuck ! Well , the worst is over , and now I am on the road to recovery . Thanks for checking on me ! Hugs to all ! "
3,FALSE,"Angie - I 've skipped over some of these posts , so somebody may have already gotten back to you on this : I 'm also on A/C . I take the 1st of the 3 Emend -LRB- the 125mg tab -RRB- on tx day , an hour before tx . I also apply the cream -LRB- Emla or generic -RRB- an hour before tx ; apply liberally & cover with saran wrap . I had a port inserted during my lumpectomy , & I 'm so glad that I did . They draw the bloodwork thru it on tx day , plus give my the pre-tx meds & then the tx 's thru it . The pre-meds they gave me on tx day were Decadron -LRB- steroid -RRB- , Aloxi -LRB- anti-nausea -RRB- , & Ativan -LRB- anti-nausea + anti-anxiety -RRB- . -LRB- Next tx , I 'm going to try w/o the Ativan ; I was exceptionally sleepy the entire day last time , & my onc said I could try w/o it or w/half dose . -RRB- On days 2 & 3 , I 'm to take Emend -LRB- 80mg -RRB- & Decadron -LRB- 8mg -RRB- in the morning ; day 4 continue with 8mg of Decadron in the morning . -LRB- I 'm going to try splittin the 4th day 's dose of Decadron into 1/2 dose on day 4 & 1/2 dose on day 5 , to lessen the post-steroid crash that I had this time , with my onc 's ok . -RRB- I also have prescriptions for Ativan as well as Compazine for use throughout the cycle , as needed - either one or the other as often as every 6 hrs . Either Ativan or Compazine may be taken together with -LRB- or overlapping -RRB- the Emend & Decadron , but the Ativan & Compazine should not be taken together or have their doses overlap . My onc told me to get Miralax , & they suggested I take a dose on tx day as a precaution -LRB- to avoid constipation -RRB- . I did n't take one that day because I had no problems in that area , let 's just say . I did take a dose of it the morning of days 2 & 3 , but have n't needed to take it since , as nature has been moving things along . -LRB- I also have Immodium on hand but have n't needed that either . -RRB- The Compazine does n't seem to be terribly constipating , at least not at the level I was taking it . I took Zofran to combat nausea from the pain meds I had after surgery , & that -LRB- plus the pain meds -RRB- was much more constipating for me . But each person is different . -LRB- A friend of mine who 's an onc nurse actually recommends using stool softeners rather than laxatives , but I went with my onc 's recommendation . Either w/b ok , though . -RRB- I took one Ativan before bed on tx day -LRB- post-tx , just to make sure I slept -RRB- , & have n't taken any since . I took one Compazine each morning on days 2 thru 6 , did n't take any more at any other time on those days , & have n't taken any since - and I 'm now on day 10 . The other thing I 'm doing , at the suggestion of alot of posters on the boards here , plus on the advice of a friend who 's an onc nurse , is taking a Pepcid Complete each morning . -LRB- You can take up to 2 of those every 24 hrs . -RRB- Yesterday I forgot to take it , had some indigestion , but nothing horrible , then remembered the Pepcid . I 've been eating whatever I feel like , whenever I feel like it - most of the time the same kinds of foods that I 'd been eating pre-chemo . A few days -LRB- for me , days 5 & 6 -RRB- I had less of an appetite & ate lighter , easier foods . Chicken soup is great , also crackers or toast , & noodle-based dishes without too much sauce or spices . I 've got 8 containers -LRB- at least a pint each -RRB- of home-cooked chicken soup in the freezer now , courtesy of a very good friend of mine . General advice re : meals - Eat smaller portions , more frequently . It 's often easier to get through a small meal or a snack , not only physically by psychologically . And once you start having more successful eating endeavors , it 'll get even easier . One general bit of advice : When people offer to help , LET THEM ! Different people can help in different ways & at different times . My soup-cooker friend happens to be a good cook & is used to cooking in large quantities , plus she 's my closest friend , so I had no trouble asking her to do this . I have other cooking-offers on hold -LRB- for when I 'll need them -RRB- , & have been spreading out the rides I ask for among several people . It really does make people feel good to help , & you 'll feel better , too ! Hope things go well for you ! "
2,TRUE,"Hi everyone , It 's been a long time since I posted here and it 's good to see some familiar names -LRB- i.e. LuAnn - hi -RRB- . I could use some advice or recommendations from any of you on what to do when an AI stops working . I have been on Femara exactly 2 yrs and my tumor cells are once again active . I am receiving radiation to my spine and have an opportunity to do a clinical trial with SU011248 in combination with Taxol versus Bevacizumbab with Taxol . Since that is a chemo protocol , my anxiety is really high ! I would like to consider transferring to another AI first and I would like to know if anyone out there has had to make this choice ? Thank you for any light that you can shed on this . Best wishes and love to all of you dealing with the `` beast '' . "
2,TRUE,"Hi Ladies , My last chemo was last week !!! So glad to have it behind me -LRB- TC X 6 -RRB- . I 'm currently going through the side effects of the last treatment but I see a light at the end of the tunnel !!! I will begin radiation in Sept. . I would like to remain off work until I am completely done with treatments . Onc said he wont release me until I am 100 % . Has anyone else remained off work during rads ? I have heard that effects of rads can differ for each person , is this true ? "
6,FALSE,"I think I have a good one here . Got diagnosed with BC in May , the exact next day after getting the horrible news , I got a call from my PS to tell me my blood tests revealed I 'm about one month pregnant too . Long story short , we wanted to keep the baby -LRB- is our first child -RRB- but we were not sure about the options or how bad the cancer was . First I had a lumpectomy by the end of May only to discover the tumor grew and had no clear edges , lucky me lymph nodes were clear and stage was I . So I went under surgery again by the end of June , this time LMX . Recovering was ok , with ups and downs and of course with some grieving of loosing a part of my body but happy at the same time to know I could continue my pregnancy . My baby girl will arrive to this world any time in mid November by scheduled c-section at 34 weeks . We ca n't wait longer cuz I need to start chemo treatment right away , and after it 5 years of Tamoxifen . You ca n't imagine how marvellous is for me to be able to keep my baby and I pray every day and cross my fingers for her to be ready at 34 weeks , of course I 'm getting all the help from doctors . My husband has been amazing and so are family and some friends . Almost all of them , e xcept this good `` friend '' of mine who got married in August to her 5 years bf . Of course I was invited to the wedding , we knew about it since last year and she wanted me to be part of the Hen 's party organizer and so on . Needless to say , the whole view changed once I got diagnosed and found out I was pregnant . I had no head , no time for anything else but my own health . May , June and July passed so fast I ca n't even remember them , the only thing I can recall is our several visits to the hospital , blood tests , visits to the PS , the onco , gyneco , obstetrician and so on . Going out for the first time after surgery and using the prosthesis was a HUGE challenge for me , our social life was a bit downhill , for obvious reasons . And there was this friend who I never got to see during this process , calling me only to `` check '' if I was doing fine and telling me `` so inspiring '' words like `` Ohh but you 'll be fine , they got it on time , You wo n't die '' and stuff like that . At the moment I was n't sure I liked or not such comments , now I know I do n't . Top of it was during one of these calls when she got a bit dissapointed I did n't join her hen 's party two weeks after my MX -LRB- a trip on a speed boat in the fjord , hell yeah ! -RRB- and also she felt upset as I did n't even `` call her '' on her hen 's party to apologize for not coming -LRB- Excuse me ! She knew I was in bed recovering not from a flu but a surgery !!! and with a growing belly ! WTF ! -RRB- Hubby told me to not take it personal and let it pass . Weeks later she called again and apologized , but her thinking was the exact same when she mentioned how lately everything was supposed to be about me , about BC , like if I was really enjoying to be the center of the universe and that I should be less selfish and care a bit more about others -LRB- like her wedding issues -RRB- ... again , excuse me ! I 've always consider myself a giver , a person who is there for everyone , but this time , I just needed and felt comfortable by the company of my husband and no one else ! She also put on me this , me spending most of the time with my husband and not longer out there in cafes with her or others . Wedding took place and of course we did n't go . But this time , I called and congrats her , sent her a wedding present with other friends . Sometimes I really wonder what goes in her head and in all those others out there who call themselves your friends but they are not . Not a single bit . I never got to see the face of this girl during the two surgeries I had , not during my recovery , nothing ! Some friends even came to my place the very next day I came home , with flowers , offering to cook , to clean and do grocery shopping for me . From her , I got just calls ... Sometimes I wan na give her the benefit of the doubt , maybe she was scared of all this BC thing , maybe she has not realized about the magnitud of this disease . I do n't know . But some friends can be really NOT . Joy "
0,TRUE,"1965sally and kimbly , I hope you both did well with your surgeries yesterday and are already on the road to a healthy recovery !

Better get your strength up , girl , cause if the next game is anything like the last one against the Penguins , you 'll be up til 4am !! Sam408 , I hope you 're doing well . Tell you what -- I 'm a big worrier , and my PS 's assistant told me : `` Do n't go looking for trouble '' , which made me and my husband both laugh -LRB- yeah , he 's a worrier , too ! -RRB- . Anyway , I 'm not saying this to minimize your concern for your flap , but hopefully your PS is right and you 're doing fine and everything is normal . I think it 's easy to worry because we 're not familiar with what `` normal '' is after this kind of surgery if we 've never experienced it before . Every little pain , swelling , etc. makes you stop and wonder what is this , is something wrong ? I 'm trying to chill out ! I hope you continue to do well and will be sending lots of positive healing thoughts . Kathy , I sent you a PM . Hugs to all , Tina "
0,TRUE,"Kathleen : - I could be mistaken but I thought that all tumors over 2 cm were treated with chemo first in order to shrink them to an operable size . However , each person is different .

5,TRUE,Hello Ladies ... I 'm comming abord the Tamoxifen train . I got my first bottle today . The onc says 5years and currently I still having chemopause -LRB- last chemo was April -RRB- . I have been reading these pages off and on and finnally made it to the end ! I noticed the info pamplet I got with the Tamox said -LRB- in caps -RRB- A NON HORMONAL BC IS RECOMMENDED for premenopausal women . So a survey of premenopausal ladies and what kind of BC your using ? I have never used a diaphram and am thinking about an iud but it sounds scary especially since I am suposed be aware of unusual bleeding . its so confusing . -LSB- emoticon : yell -RSB-
0,TRUE,"Thank you for all your replies , it does help to hear other people have gone before me down this road . I just do not feel sick at all , does anyone feel sick before the diagnosis is made ? It is like your life is very much on hold , you just ca n't move on yet , until it is resolved . I lost my mother 3 months ago she lived with me my entire life , it was very hard to loose someone , especially one who was as loving , kind and unselfish as she was . I had just began to get over her death enough to function in the world , then I get thrown this news . The mind is a funny thing , so complex how it handles events in your life . I know one thing , I believe in an afterlife , without being a religious finatic , I think our spirit lives on . I do n't attend church on a regular basis , I have a distrust of organized religion , my relationship with God is a personal one , and I do search and ask why things happen . Am I wrong in thinking , well it is destiny that my life is to be shortened and cancer is what is planned for me . I just do n't fight it or question , I just say , I will endure was is given to me , and there is a reason . People fear pain and suffering , not death . It 's how we get there to the point of death that most concerns human beings . If I were a much younger person , I would most likely be very scared , but for some reason I feel my life has been lived the way I wanted , experienced many happy moments , treasured my family , it has been good , so no regrets whatever happens . I love the fact there is a website like this for support during the anxious moments , and I will be there also for those on the website who are going through the hard times , and offer my support and help anyway I can give it , if only to respond or let someone know I am thinking of them and maybe helping to cope . You have to let this go into the hands of the professionals , your family and your spiritual beliefs , this is what will help get us all through no matter how it ends . "
0,TRUE,"One Step , my advice , though I did n't have a Mx , is take someone with you to help write things down and listen . It is going to be an emotional visit and you may forget things .

0,TRUE,"Hi Jordymom , thanks for your reply . I 've been trying to weigh the pros and cons all day - ca n't seem to turn my mind off even for a minute - Just went thru one heck of a crying spell , which I do n't normally do . Everyone has given me the facts too and said I could make whatever choice I wanted -LRB- Doc recommended lumpectomy so I went with that even though my first thought was mast . -RRB- Problem is as you said when you do consider pros and cons of both they do come out equal and there is no right choice . I 'm afraid either way . I just keep hoping something will come about to help me say yeah , thats the right road for me . I really do have to make a choice soon . thanks again . "
0,TRUE,"Nash , for whatever it 's worth . My tumor was deep and 2 mm from the chest wall . I had IDC , ILC , LCIS and DCIS all in the same tumor . My surgeon said I did n't need rads but after consultation with rads oncologist I did opt for rads due to location of tumor and 1 pos node . I also opted for a bi-lateral and they found atypical lobular hyperplasia in my good breast so it probably would have turned into ILC down the road . Anyway , I had immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders/impants and had rads on the expanders after chemo . I had my final implant exchange surgery six months later and I have not encountered any problems . It is possible to have implants and rads even though the plastic surgeon gets a little nervous about it . "

0,TRUE,"I have not gone on estradiol YET , but it may be an option for me down the road , I just returned from Houston TX where I spent a week and had a consultaion with an oncologist at MD Anderson who thinks I may have been taken off the aromasin prematurely since the only change he noted in reviewing my records was that my tumor markers had gone up and he said often there is a jump up and if you give a medication enough time it will go back down . My tumors did increase in both number and size before going on the chemo that I quit back in July because of bad SE 's and he feels that since I did get new mets while on Faslodex it is the one that was not working . So his recommendation is to go back on the aromasin and if that fails he recommends megace or high dose estrogen -LRB- estradial -RRB- which my onco said he thought would be very risky for me to do since I was so estrogen + . So I am just thrilled to death that I do n't have to do more chemo as of now and that this onco who specializes in hormonal treatments by the way , agrees that estradiol is often a very effective way of treating advanced breast cancer I am hoping my onco will go along with this and I am getting my RX for aromasin filled and plan on starting it again on MOn and will continue to get my monthly zometa . How are you doing Robin ... did you get the surgery and is estrodial still working for you ? "
6,TRUE,"It 's so great to be sailing on this big love boat with all my sisters ! I am 47 , and working hard on planning my husband 's big 5-0 in May - I think he 'll be surprised since he thinks I 'm kinda preoccupied right now - little does HE know ! Chemo on Tuesday went well - AC - have had MINIMUAL side effects , if any , really so far ! Insomnia and lazy as hell , but no nauseau or any of the stuff I was dreading . Have been on Emend , and the Neulasta has not been a problem . My family Dr gave me some sleeping pilss whose name I ca n't recall right now -LRB- Lunesta ! That 's it ! -RRB- and Onc said ok to take so got at least 4 hours last night . I too have been keeping a journal of what I take each day and how I feel , just because there 's too much to remember and I do n't want to OD myself ! I guess I should try the senekot just to keep things moving . I went shopping alone 45 minutes away after the Neualasta shot and went to pick up my wigs yesterday , but had a girlfriend drive me there .

0,TRUE,"Here I stand shivering on the edge of the high board , squeze my eyes shut , pinch my nose and ... JUMP . After 13 years of actively not wanting to know , I recently stumbled on this site and am now considerably more knowledgeble about my case and ready to REVEAL ALL -LRB- and hopefully receive revelations from others -RRB- . May 26 , 1996 , enjoying a liesurely shower before dressing in beige befitting the mother of the groom , I discovered the lump . A BIG lump - 8cm . One week later I was enrolled in protocol seeking to discover if taxotere in combination with the gold standard chemo mix could shrink the tumor to the point that a lumpectomy would be as effective as a radical mastectomy . In my case the answer was a dramatic yes . Everything went along swimmingly : surgery , radiation , Tamoxifen and at last , the 5 year victory bell . I was cured ! Not only that , but unlike many of my friends of a certain age I had no health problems . No high blood pressure or cholesterol , not overweight , no arthrihtis so no joint replacements , no heart problems , not even cataracts . I was now 60 , ready to retire and ready to roll out and do something new and useful to save the world and have fun doing it . But wait - what is that nagging pain in my hip ? You say thats not the hip ? Its called the sacrum ? And it contains the most worrisome of 3 bone metastases ? OOPS ! Crank up the broad beam radiation , Arrimidex , Zometa , 5 different Cyberknife sessions . More trouble , switch to xeloda . A lymph node pops up and up - zap it with radiation . But suddenly last month I can barely walk . I have lost much sensation in my legs and feet over the years caused by nerve damage from the sacral tumor . This is nothing new . Pain , dropped foot , a cold and wasted leg , not to mention -LRB- I usually do n't -RRB- bowel and bladder problems , have all originated under the auspices of the sacral tumor and have been slowly debilitating me for the past 5 years . But now I can barely balance on my own 2 feet without toopling over and can only lurch very slowly and very carefully from pillar to post . Sometimes even that does n't work and I have 2 black eyes to prove it . I also have a new doctor on the team - a neuro oncologist . New doctor = new words to learn : lumbo - sacral plexopathy , radiculopathy , cord compression . All scary because they arrive accompanied by the term `` nerve infiltration . '' No longer am I a no brainer , paint by the numbers case with a few simple bone mets . Now I have 3 docs , my oncologist , the radiologist and the neuro-oncologist . I hear they were kicking my case around trying to decide what happens next . Most likely another round of Xeloda from what I can glean.I was never present at these conferences but I get the feeling that the neuro oncologist sees bad things coming down the track for me . In a few weeks I 'll be 68 , definitely old enough for this ole biddy thread , doncha think ? So I ask : Is anyone out there still awake at 1:43 EDT ? Ever been down a long and dusty road that looked like thisone ? Do you know where this story goes next ? I 'd love to hear from you ! "

I burst into tears and said `` I do n't want to look !!! '' She and my husband agreed we could put it off , and wait to change bandages . The next morning I took an Ativan , waited for it to kick in , then looked at it by myself . It turned out not to be as bad as I 'd expected . The plastic surgeon had put in an implant and filled it a little in anticipation of a DIEP down the road , so it looked kind of like a 12-13 year old 's boob .

2,FALSE,"Roxy , Tamoxifen is a good drug so do n't fret .

I agree with Tender that you need to eat . Shortly after treatment I consulted with a natural health nutritionist because I knew that I needed to build back up my immune system . One thing pointed out to me was the importance of protein . I was very close to a vegan and was not getting enough protein . I now drink an organic why protein shake every morning -LRB- made from cows not treated with growth hormones -RRB- and organic eggs . I was surprised that she told me it was okay to eat eggs everyday and did n't realize how healthy they are . I was going wild right after my diagnosis with eating veggies but I do n't think I was getting enough good fats and proteins . I use a lot of estra virgin organic olive oil now to help put on some pounds . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weighed 113 lbs -LRB- definately underweight -RRB- . Now two years after treatment I weight 120 lbs and am not considered underweight . I am not as anal about my food . I still eat very healthy and eat as much organic as I can . I do n't eat much dairy except I continue to eat organic yogurt because I truly believe it is very healthy . I eat free range chicken -LRB- when I can -RRB- and bison or organic beef . I try to eat bison at least once a week . I eat some fish but try to eat only wild salmon , talapia or other cold water healthy fish . I drink lots of green tea and try to stay away from soy .

Ya ' have to get the ones there cause they go the fastest and turn the tightest . The ones in Walmart-do not compare !!!

There is a theme that runs through these boards -- hit the beast at first with everything you 've got so hopefully you never see it again . Its just harder to treat the cancer if it comes back . Perhaps you should go to the moving on section and ask about the long term effects of rads . Most of us would says we have none . Some women report aches and pains down the road .

I think targeted treatment is what I need since it is really only this one tumor that is growing ... at least for now . I also wish you a Happy New Year ... hope 2010 is a good one for all of us . "
0,FALSE,"Hi Suez ! Thanks for the response :--RRB- and I am sorry for ur news as well , def not the best way to start off the New Year . How long after the diagnosis did you have the surgery ? As far as determining the stage the cancer is in , is this determined after the surgery ? My mother has been diagnosed and I am helping her through and trying to understand the condition as much as I can for myself and also for her . I want to be able to ask the right questions to the doctors ... Her diagnosis came from a doctor in the Oncology dept. at Montefiore -LRB- dont know if you remember the Bronx but its on Eastchester road , we live on Castle Hill -RRB- . She will be getting a second and third opinion as well . I came across Sloan Kettering in my research , but she is going to visit 2 other places . Thanks so much for the info and I will definitely be in touch :--RRB- I begin to feel a little better each day as I become more knowlegable about this ... "
6,TRUE,"Hehe . I just had a `` born again '' show up in one of the other forums I post on who was railing against non-theists and how arrogant we are . He seems to feel we care about his rantings and does n't realize that the threats he gives us from his imaginary friend have no relevence to us ! He did try to do the `` god is punishing you '' over my cancer diagnosis . I told him that I 'm sorry he feels that way because a lot of other women in the same boat as I who are highly religious and believe in the same imaginary being he does are also dying of cancer . So apparently , according to his own logic , you 're damned if you do n't ... and damned if you do ! Nice ! "
2,TRUE,"I was diagnosed with Stage III BC on 6-6-08 at the age of 31 . My cancer was very aggressive . Cancer at any age is horrible ... but I have to tell you that cancer in your early 30 's REALLY SUCJS ...

I actually error on the side of being negative ... =-RRB- But I have to tell you that positive thoughts and attitude go along way ! I have been off of all treatment -LRB- besides tamoxifen -RRB- for 6 months and in `` remission '' for a year . My oncologist says that im doing well and exactly where they want me to be . I still have a long way to go ... I also am one of those people who dont have the need or want to know my `` prognosis '' . I believe that it can be beat ... and Im gon na do everything in my power to make sure that I do beat it . Just know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel ...

I , too , have the cracked rib feeling especially on one side and no one told me -LRB- although I did see all the posts about the te pain -RRB- how this reconstruction stuff would be . I feel like I 'm in mid-evil times wearing this IRON BRA 24/7 . I go see the PS tomorrow to check on the infection again . I have now been on the Levaquin for 13 days and I have a lot of medical friends who are concerned about me being on this for more than two weeks -- guess I 'll quiz him on it tomorrow . How are you doing ? I 'm happy things are going well for you so far -- you deserve it ! "
0,TRUE,"Cynthia ? What was your EF ? Or would you rather exchange info in a PM ?

At that time mine was at 61 % and the one recently showed 55 % , so I kind of disgruntled , that I was n't told about the effects of the A/C until I was given a photocopy of SE 's after the treatment was basically over with .

5,FALSE,"Well , yesterday morning I woke up so nauseated I thought I was going to hurl before we even left the house . I did n't sleep AT ALL that night and looked like total HELL !!! We took the train in had lunch at the Brigham and Women 's cafeteria -LRB- much better than Dana Farber 's FYI if you ever need to know -RRB- because it took me two hours to even think of eating ANYTHING . We get to Dana , and I sign in and find out that my onc is running an hour late , so I go in to panic mode and say I am supposed to start at 2:30 what do we do ? Do we go without talking to her panic panic panic !!! So the very nice lady , obviously used to crazy people told us to go to the waiting room for my vitals . On the way in this tech stopped me and told me my fly was open . So I 'm called in for my vitals , and it 's the same lab tech ! And I just love her !! I go in and she asked the dreaded `` are you having any pain ? '' question , and I told her that actually all the cancer was gone in the operation and this was all preventative chemo . I also told her my blood pressure was going to be sky high and we took bets on it , and I won . She was awesome . She had me laughing before I was out of there and I wish I could get her every time . Then I go in for the IV . I get the thing put in and then the tech says you are getting bla bla and HERCEPTIN and I am like NO I 'M NOT !!! -LRB- Blood pressure back to 140/100 pulse through the roof -RRB- So she says well that 's ok just check with the doc before you go up . So we have about a 45 minute wait where I see another woman who is starting today , someone with a hand full of films and another woman who reminded me of me who was clearly at the beginning of her nightmare and num because she was jabbering in this overly happy , numb way that I did at the beginning . I really felt for her especially because she had this gorgeous thick blond hair that went down to the middle of her back and I knew she would be having an even tougher time than I was with this . It was too bad too because she was alone . My heart went out to her . Anyway , we finally get in and my doctor 's nurse practitioner is there and she asks me how I am doing and I start going a mile a minute about how scared I am about everything and I freak out about the whole Herceptin thing . That was straightened out . I guess because they had to reserve the longest infusion time and the actual order went up with me . And I was give all the facts and in the middle my oncologist came in and it was all good and I went up to the infusion room . Each chair had its own area that could be closed off if you wanted to , my nurse was awesome ! I am on four rounds of Cytoxin and Andriamycin followed by four rounds of Taxol . I wish that the doc would say this is the cure . But they wo n't and I understand but I want to hear that word so bad it hurts . But 85 % chance of never dealing with this again is nothing to complain about ! So while I sit through the infusion , my darling husband runs around to fill the nausea med prescription and make the appointment in Plastic Surgery and for the wig styling for me and I feel totally fine . We took the subway back to the train station and realize that the train riding days are over . My husband says he does n't want me to catch the `` SARS-Bird-Flu-Malaria '' on the train ! I love how he can make me laugh no matter what ! I woke up at 4:00 am with my stomach feeling queasy . I do n't know if it was because of the chemo or nerves . But I took the meds at 8:00 am anyway . I am popping in to work only long enough to get some work to do at home . My shots came to the house yesterday and hubby was shown how to give them to me so that is all set . I have decided not to get my hair cut today . I will do it next week . Actually I am feeling better about the whole thing this morning for some reason . Maybe because there were so many people in one place yesterday talking about it to me and taking it in stride . This one lady heard me talking about how horrified I was with the nurse and she came right over to talk . I guess I am still amazed at the kindness of people , and how they have been reaching out to me . Maybe its because I am a child abuse survivor . I know that this whole experience has brought a lot of issues I thought were dead and buried back that has n't been fun . But I have to say to all of you who I absolutely value more than I ever expected , I am in a much more peaceful place this morning . I did not wake up afraid for the first time in many months and that is a huge surprise especially because I think of how terrified I was yesterday . I know this will not all be smooth sailing but I feel like most of the `` unknown '' is out of the picture now and that makes it a lot easier to deal with . Thanks for reading , I know this was a book !!! Love to all !!!! Robyn "

But breast cancer is so much less a part of my life -LRB- less part of what I do , think about , worry about -RRB- than it was last winter .

When you talk to people about it they always say it will grow back and its true it will . But it still sucks . I just want to offer to you a word of advise . Drink a ton of water no matter how bad you think it tastes . Stay ahead of nausea with good meds . Take claritin if you get nurlasta injections the day after chemo infusion .

2,FALSE,"I have just come back from Paris -LRB- I have a studio/apartment there . -RRB- I was only there for 2 weeks instead of a month . . just in case there was a medical emergency . I have regained a lot of my strength and am not taking afternoon naps any more . All the anesthesia and stress really had its ' way with me . So the good part is that I am getting back to normal strength-wise . The bad part of it all is that we have a big beautiful full wall mirror in the Paris bathroom with great light . Uugh ! So now I am dealing with the puckered , messed up chest that I must call mine . The possibility of another surgery scares me . First of all it would have to be the kind that takes the muscle and skin flap from my back ; no simple implant is possible with my situation now . And then I would be compromising my arm strength and I need it for my painting and transporting large works . So the truth is unless I have a brain transplant , I ca n't see subjecting myself to a big surgery when I am finally coming back to myself . But as the reality of what has happened sinks in , I am dealing with disappointment in how it all turned out . I spent today in my studio . I just made a little painting for a benefit auction for a breast cancer division of a hospital in a Brooklyn neighborhood that is poor and under - served . It is the least I can do . Mostly I am happy . I feel like I was at the water cooler when someone `` went postal . '' But I also feel like I had some really bad recon luck . i love to hear what everyone is doing . Do n't get me wrong - I am grateful for the good things that came my way , like just having LCIS . But I 'll tell you fillies , my dreams while I am working this all out , are pretty surreal . Just remember , every time you get admiring looks for your foobs , send a little my way . It has been a while since men made sucking noises at me from construction sites , but I can dream , ca n't I ? I must say my falsies are pretty good , though and the pain on the donor site of my skin graft just feels like a bad sunburn now.So fill away and keep posting on this site so I know what 's happening ! femme "

4,TRUE,"I will be finding out my chemo treatment tomorrow . I was diagnosed last month and have been on the roller coaster ride since then . I 'm 37 and have 2 kids and have a hard time believing that this is all actually happening . After the initial mammograms , biopsies , MRI , genetic tests and hormone receptor results , I was told I was stage 1 and that this may not require chemo . Then I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy . I thought the hardest part was the waiting , until I discovered that they were wrong about my negative sentinel node biopsy results and a few days later told me that I am actually node positive . That was a tough day . I go back and forth between realizing that I 'm lucky to have discovered all of this when I did and then feeling miserable because I 've got the worst luck ever . So , I suspect that tomorrow the oncologist will help me find my plan . I 'm hoping that once I at least have a plan , then I 'll start to feel a little bit better about my situation . 2010 is shaping up to be one tough year .

The Onc . prescribed steroids and pain killers . Nausea , I remember puking , laying on the bathroom floor , semi passed out , waking up , puking , pass back out , doing it over and over again . It was the first time I saw the bottom of a toilet . My feet hurt to much to keep walking back and forth from bedroom to bathroom . By the time the pain started to lessen , it was time for another tx . Mentally , I thought for sure I was going to be committed .

2,FALSE,PET scans are famous for false positives . It will show uptake for arthritis and disc problems .

They 're a combination of guided images , affirmations and music that put the experience you 're facing in a much more positive light .

That as I 'm sure you know is much easier said than done . There are so many risks and I ca n't go through the trama of having it happen again , nor can I live with prosthesis . It is all so overwhelming . I see neither one of you had to have chemo am I correct ? Well chemo was very scary , but I just dealt with it and did it . This radiation is another issue all together . Not only am I just plain scared of the radiation they are putting in my body , I am so scared I will lose that expander . Thank you for saying I am strong ... I do n't feel very strong right now . I am just so tired of the whole cancer journey . It has been a long road and I still have a long road ahead .

His is usually better . Life is life and often , things happen that just are not fair or right . Cancer is the worst diagnosis I can think of . I know in my darkest hours , I hated God , but He already knew that . I need not be ashamed of my doubt . I often write angry letters to my Lord about the lastest diagnosis of BC . My Lord knows my heart in faith and in those dark souless nights when I am so lost . I promise that you are loved , cared for and the apple of His eye .

Not perfect - or anything close to what used to be there , but perfect for me at the time ... I ended up having to have rads as one malignant area was very close to the chest wall .

I 'm comfortable with my new breasts -LRB- I had an IGAP in June -RRB- , but they are different from the original set for sure . A bilateral was the right choice for me at the time .

It is actually bigger than us and its so frustrating having control of nothing . You ca n't choose how you feel , how long you will be down , what you will or can feel like eating , or even have a BM when you need to , so I really feel totally out of control . The nausea goes away from the tx then I get nausea from the constipation . I am using miralax and Senna s and prunes . I had tx # 2 on monday the 7th and really didnt feel very well until Saturday but thankfully I felt well for mothers day . and the weather here was nice .

I have recently been introduced to the use of Bioptron light -LRB- http://www.lymph.com.au/category4_1.htm -RRB- . They claim that the light can stimulate light-sensitive intracellular structures and moleculesm . This then initiates cellular chain reactions which in turn helps reduce the swelling .

She may have her own anger and fears about her past cancer , and may want to share some of it with you now that you are an adult women with this disease as well . This is a very lonely road , having breast cancer , maybe she needs to hear you tell her how you can see how hard it must have been for her at a time when women with breast cancer underwent mastectomies and chemo before there were new treatments .

0,TRUE,"Had neoadjavant chemo , Post chemo MRI showed no signs of cancer anywhere so I went the suggestion of my surgeon and had the lumpectomy and axilliry node dissection seeing i did have needle aspiration at time of biopsy and came up positive in one node .

2,TRUE,"Trigeek , I have been thinking of your dilemma , both from my own experience , and from a medical point of view . I did get LE after a + SLN turned ALND , and then undergoing radiation , which included some radiation , but not as much to the axilla . Is this right ? You had two axillary lymph nodes found in SLNB and at least one of them had lymphatic invasion ? You wish to consider no further axillary surgery -LRB- i.e. no full axillary dissection -RRB- partially due to it 's attendant risk of LE -LRB- lymphedema -RRB- among other -LRB- nerve cutting and numbness -RRB- , and wish to consider radiation to the chest wall and axilla , and are aware it also carries a risk of LE development . Regrettably , a prospective , randomized -LRB- forward looking , two studied events randomly assigned in an otherwise matching group -RRB- clinical study which would have helped to answer this time immemorable question was closed in 2004 due partially to poor patient accrual . It was called the ACOSOG Z0011 , or the American College of Surgical Oncology Group Z0011 . They got as far as 900 or so enrollees , yet to date , I do not find any publication on their results -LRB- may be too early , or there wo n't be any -RRB- . So in light of no clear prospective clinical trial answer whether full axillary LN dissection can be replaced by full axillary radiation after + SLNB , many doctors turn to what is called the standard of care as their guidance . It appears that generally , ALND remains the standard of care for patients with a positive SLN . In your case , because you had 1 or 2 positive SLN 's , the question is are there more positive nodes ? As you said , categories of 1-3 , 4-9 , and 10 and above have been developed in breast cancer staging . Bernard Fisher helped establish by 1977 that the step-wise progression of breast cancer to regional lymph nodes and then beyond was not always or even typically the case , and his and many subsequent studies now form the basis for the opinion that cancer cells spread through lymphatic , and lymph-vein channels systemically in addition to regional spread at some point in a cancers growth . With increasing numbers of LN involvement , their is greater likelihood of systemic or body spread of cells . Largely due to this , the use of chemotherapy for ablation of possible distant spread developed resulting in great improvements in survival from breast cancer . It has not been established that surgical excision of lymph nodes containing cancer results in increased survival , as in a so called therapeutic lymph node removal . Yet some studies have suggested that if the volume of cancer in a lymph node or chain of lymph nodes is large , they may pose a recurrence risk in the axilla , as radiation their does not always result in absence of recurrence . The debate goes back and forth . Only you can decide your answer to this complex issue . Axillary dissection plus axillary radiation pushes the risk of LE up considerably . It 's hard to even give a percent range , yet somewhere between perhaps 18 to 30 % combined risk of LE seems about right . You get all kinds of quotes on percents of LE from surgery alone on the axilla , radiation alone on the axilla , yet all agree that the combination treatment yields the highest risk and if possible , is better avoided . That 's where best evidence levels come in to discussion . Radiation is felt justified , i.e. falls under best evidence for women with 4 or more nodes , but the grey area of 1 to 3 nodes being positive for cancer is inconclusive : meaning , there is not enough evidence to allow conclusion either for or against it . Indeed , over the last 8 years ago , this too has been hotly debated , and a randomized , prospective study on radiation or no radiation in the 1-3 node positive patient closed of late , also due to lack of accrual . We are all so individual in our thoughts and reasons for electing one therapy and perhaps not another . There is only one person who can decide their course along with their physicians . I know you are thinking it through carefully , and applaud your question . I wish there were answers easily available to these seemingly basic questions in breast cancer given all the years of study . We are making progress in breast cancer , yet clearly more needs to come . All the best to you , Tender I 'll post a few links to references on this topic as you requested : http://www.nccn.org and http://www.asco.org The Management of Regional Lymph Nodes in Cancer http://www.breastcancerchoices.org/pharis.html Positive sentinel lymph nodes should be followed by axillary lymph node dissection http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBCO%2FS1470903107003847a.pdf&code=14d6a91b1fac180e90aecae20ceafeb1 "

I had the reconstruction process started on September 24th -LRB- expansions in now -RRB- along with a bi-lateral mastectomy and 26 lymph nodes removed , with only 2 being removed . I am not sure how old your children are , but I have two boys , ages 6 and 9 . They do not know that I have `` cancer '' . I am going to wait until they are a little older to tell them . THey jsut know that mommy is not well right now , but working on feeling better . The hair thing was the hardest for me to explain to them because I now have none . I told my children that I was going to be taking medicine that was going to make my hair look pretty bad , so I was going to jsut shave it off and let it grow back . They ask me all the time when my hair will grow back , when I can do this , etc. . ANd it is hard , but , you kind of have to learn to manage . I do not know if you work or not , but I work , and I am a very hard worker and it has killed me that I have been out of work since 9-23-08 . I want to go back , but feel tired , or ca n't risk getting sick becuase unfortuenatly for me , my treatment plan has n't gone as `` scheduled '' . I am a petite person , and weighed 90 pounds going into this , and when I had my first treatment , on October 31st , 2008 , I went 4ξ1/2 weeks before my next treatment . It had wiped my white blood counts out . Even after a neulasta shot . So , I do not know when normalcy will come into play again , but it does get better each day .

0,TRUE,"As I understand it , the breast will drain into one primary sentinel node . Sometimes it becomes 2 nodes if they are nearby each other and the drainage is shared . Once a mx is done , there is no way to check which is the `` gatekeeper '' node any longer , so if there is a suspicion of CA , they 'll want to check the nodes along with the mx . However , if a mx is prophylactic , then no cancer is assumed . The risk for lymphedema is not a solid number at this time , as there are many variables , the primary one being how many lymph nodes were taken out . That said , there are those who have developed LE with no sentinel node disturbance - the mx surgery itself was enough . Things that can also set it off later down the road are : blood pressure taken , needle sticks , infected bug bites , pressure changes experienced while flying in a plane - anything which can compromise pressure or stimulate an inflammatory response . Some people are triggered more easily than others . Some swell more than others .

0,TRUE,"I 'm glad I came across this post . I just posted a similar question in the stage 4 pages . I was diagnosed Oct. 08 stage 4 @ diagnosis . Finished 6 mo. chemo and have been on Femara & Lupron for 18 months . Have gained 30 lbs . and am now probably considered obese . I had a lap band procedure in April 08 because I am diabetic but had to have the saline removed when I was diagnosed . My oncologist suggested to me on Friday that I may want to consider having the band filled again to help lose this weight ... for the reasons you mention about the fat storing hormones . I 'm seriously thinking about it as I have responded extremely well to treatment and although I am stage 4 do not want my extra weight to cause other problems down the road , either with my diabetes or my breast cancer . Great post ! "
0,TRUE,"I 've been following the Robin Roberts story , Amy -LRB- the one in the `` Moving Beyond '' section , right ? There is another but I ca n't remember where -RRB- , but I have n't seen the part about journalists becoming the story yet . Personally , I do n't think she really had a choice . As a broadcast news personality that millions wake up with everyday -LRB- gheesh that sounds weird -RRB- , she probably could have taken a leave of absence and done her treatment , but the public would have wanted to know what she was up to and why she was away . In other words , whether she did disclose her dx/treatment journey or she did n't , it would have made news . I can identify a bit because I struggled with how public I wanted to get about my own BC journey . It took me about two years to write about it , but unlike Robin , I had an option because my face is n't as well known as her 's . We all know this road is tough enough without having to do it in the public eye . I really feel for her ... "
4,TRUE,"Hi , I was wondering if anyone is starting the chemo combo of taxotere and cytoxan late Jan or early Feb. 2011 . I have read so many comments and researched it but that is n't the same as having somebody along for the `` ride '' with you . Cyberbuddies so to speak . My Oncotype Dx came back with a 35 score which is high for re - occurrence so my oncologist recommended this combo for me given the other factors in this cancer . My first dose is Jan. 31,2011 and I will 4 cycles in 3 months and then take Arimidex for 5 years . "
0,TRUE,"I was just diagnosed with IBC on 7/16/09 . I have no rash or anything , as of yet . My symptoms started out only around 6/21/09 with my right breast burning and tenderness around the nipple area . Then I noticed a lump and pains started under my right arm . My breast was red at times , off and on , and felt real full . I went to my PCP and he set me up with appointments for diagnostic mamograms at the UWHC , here in Wisconsin . From then , things have been happening very fast , which I give the doctors there so much credit for . I had an ultrasound after my mamo , which showed 2 tumors in my breast and 1 under my arm . I had biopsies done the following week and the fine needle aspiration under my arm showed cancer cells in the lymph nodes . We did n't even wait for the pathology report to get back , I saw an oncolgists the very next day . The next day I had a ct scan and mri . The next day a heart test and then the very next day started chemo . The plan of attack for me is 16 weeks of chemo , then surgery , followed by radiation treatments . The ct scan looked fine , which was a major relief to me because I was so scared that it had already spread to other places . I am not looking forward to the long road ahead , but I am staying as positive as I can about totally curing this invador . I am in a good hospital , with fabulous doctors , and together we got stared attacking this in the best way we know how . "
2,TRUE,"You 're right , Donna it does . I 'm sorry first that there is one rib of concern , and now an additional two . Thank goodness you and your Mom went to your oncologist . What is it with the `` wait and see '' approach anyway ? I know of few people with cancer and pain and + bone scan findings , with your history , who could wait and see for 3 more months . Since the first bone did n't `` heal '' from the fracture diagnosis , and now there are two additional ribs which seem involved in a process , it 's time for action . So you 'll get your CT scan to delineate the area better . It may well be that your oncologist and orthopedist will suggest a biopsy from the most accessible bone . This would be most helpful to rule out any breast cancer , and if it is breast cancer , to recheck your tumor markers . It 's very important to recheck the ER and the HER marker if tissue is obtained , as some 20 % or more of ER+HER - breast cancers will change to ER + HER + , maybe even VEGF + breast cancer . Knowing this will allow therapy specified to your current state if it turns out as recurrent breast cancer . I 'm so sorry you 're going through this , and my personal wish is this is all benign . I could n't see that you had radiation therapy , yet you have a rad oncologist so it appears you did . Bone fractures do occur in bones previously radiated , but with breast cancer that 's hormone positive , we need to ensure that by proper testing . Especially in light of the AI 's and Fulvestrant -LRB- Falsodex -RRB- which offer non-chemotherapy control . Do keep in mind the HER issue , as that has been shown in multiple studies and allows treatment with anti HER drugs . Please keep us posted . I am glad your Mom was there with you , and that you have each other . All the best , djd , Tender "

0,TRUE,"You post whenever you want . To me that is what the point of this forum is . We have people telling us how to feel , what to do , what might happen , etc. . Ask questions , ask as many as you want . Deciding about treatments is huge and I do n't feel you need to be chastised . For heaven 's sake none of us really know the `` right '' thing to do for our individual situation so I began by listening to my gut and increasing knowledge about the options . I will tell you this . The moment I was informed that I needed a biopsy I said I wanted both breasts removed . That no matter what was going on I knew enough about myself and my little brain to understand that the worry of reocurrance could damage me as much as cancer . It upset a lot of people to say that without any results . I have no regrets . My cancer was apparently stage I-II only 5 mm invasive in right breast HR+PR + Her - and no nodes involved -LRB- I am not an expert on all the codes and ratings -RRB- followed by immediate reconstruction . I have actually had people tell me that since it was a small cancer do n't I regret the fullon surgery . NO , I do not . I have no great affinity for my breast when compared to living . We have a lot of choices and few at the same time . Know your mind , dig deep and go with your gut . That is how i landed up with a great team - breast surgeon , plastic surgeon and oncologist . The first two work together as a wonderful team and the last I sought out because he is one of the best in the country . I knew the one who took care of the followup would be crucial to my living . There was a bit of resistance to `` break '' the team but it was my choice . On the other hand , I needed no other interviews with surgeons as my GUT told me these two were the ones to go with . Not my type of personalities that I care for yet an instinct said they were going to be it . ONCO test is a great thing and worth every penny . Mine finally came back yesterday and gives the oncologist guidelines as to what hormone therapy will best be suited to me . I had a low score of 6 and the science behind all of this is amazing . Lots of choices out there.I chose not have a lumpectomy -LRB- one of my options -RRB- as I did not want chemotherapy and radiation with the chance of having to go back in and take the whole breast . I wanted to `` reserve '' the radiation if this little bastard ever pops somewhere else down the road . Again , my choice . The primary surgeon laid out the options and I said I aleady know which way I am going . Gut instinct with a nod to reason . That should guide you . Do n't be rude but ask questions . Take half of what you read online and toss it as fellow women being in pain and confusion . Glean the terms and look them up , see what they mean and how they apply to you . Some do and some do n't . The pain described is right and wrong . It is a personal pain that only your body will serve up to you . When it hurts , it hurts like the dickens , when it does n't it is wonderful and a glimpse that all will eventually be ok . If you ca n't rant here-what is the point ? That is why normally groups of any kind repel me , for there is too much chastising and corrections . I am all for keeping it real if someone is urging people to drink camel milk as a cure but I imagine under the fear most of us are rather intelligent women who are looking for solace and solutions to help us through this wicked road . Good luck and keep in touch ! "

0,TRUE,"Booblet , you 're young and healthy , and yes , you deserve reconstruction ! The advantage to choosing to reconstruct now as opposed to later is that you 'll have less scarring with immediate reconstruction .

I woke up with breasts , so I never really had to deal with the sense of loss that so many have . Yes , they were changed , but the girls were still there . I only have numbness in the center of each breast , and the numb area of my abdomen is only 4 '' x 4 '' . My ab scar has faded so much that I do n't mind it at all -- the tummy tuck bonus was so worth it ! I did have some bumps in the road , and had to find a real DIEP expert when I realized my first surgeon was n't going to give me the beautiful outcomes I was seeing online .

However in February of this year I was diagnosed with DCIS , Sclerosing Adenosis , Radial Scar and atypical columnar changes !! My Surgeon is recommending Mastectomy and sent me for a 2nd opinion where they recommended an MRI to make sure it is only DCIS and not Invasive Disease and also to see whether there is any DCIS in the other breast too . If there is it will mean bilateral mastectomies , if not just the one . But then I suppose if there 's any evidence of invasive disease that will shed a different light on things too .

However , I do n't know what these -LRB- almost girdle-like -RRB- garments are supposed to fit like , but I am usually a size 4 , and I am wearing a size large tank and it still has lots of support -LRB- and this was with no fill at all -RRB- .

I 've made the rounds at Target and K-Mart for a few pieces of cheaper short-term clothes , and Kohl 's and Boscov 's for undergarments . I started physical therapy last week , went twice . She said I was doing very well , so I 'm off the paranoia wagon about being way behind range-of-motion-wise . I 've been trying to walk a few times a week , and find this goes a long way for lifting my spirits . The rainy weather had put a slight damper on things for a few days , but now it 's just beautiful outside . I 've been hanging out over on the Breast Reconstruction thread since I 've started my fills . Yesterday was my second one , and , same as the first , left me feeling quite uncomfortable . Less pain than the first time , but I prepared a little better -- hot shower , valium , and pain pill at the ready for the car ride if I sensed a start in pain . I did start to feel it , so I popped the pain med and was able to stay ahead of the pain curve . Today I feel slightly swollen , and I have a PT appt. , so we 'll see how that goes . I think we 'll have to go easy this session . Sheila , it really is hard to not do things we 're not allowed to do . Every once in a while I find myself picking up something a little heavy , and think , oh carp ! , put that thing down . I hope your PS gives you good news about your flap and that it is healing nicely . Your path is so much tougher than mine , girl , and I have such admiration and respect for your determination . I feel like such a weenie complaining about my much smaller issues . Hugs , Tina "
0,TRUE,Thanks . I do n't feel that I have done it too soon . My last chemo was Oct 30th and my BM was Dec 6th . It took a lot out of me ... that is major surgery for sure . I will just be glad when it is done and over with . Been a long journey and tired of the trip ! You are on the road to healing and I agree that it does take a lot out of you .
4,TRUE,"My insurance came through and approved my PET , so tomorrow is the day , results with my wonderful onc on Thurs. . I was totally relaxed about it until today . Out of the blue , I have major shoulder pain in my left arm - how random is that ? Oh well , at least I 'll have the scan to figure out if it is something to worry about or not . I 've also had off-and-on nausea the past couple weeks ... hoping that is nothing . I 'm not really anxious , but well ... maybe a little . This is my first scan since switching from chemo to Femara and I want a L-O-N-G ride on Femara . "

I have two girlfriends taking me the first time and I am going to take cards and dice . Also , my laptop as they said they have WI-FI . What about reading a book ? I have n't been to the library yet , but would like to pick up a book to read as well . I have read several suggestions . I went yesterday and got a wig from a salon that partners for ACS . They only had a few to pick from but I got one that will have to do ! The stylist cut it a little and shaped it around my face . I had my hair cut short about two weeks ago and everyone has said how much they like me with short hair ... wonder how they will like me with no hair ? I keep telling myself it will grow back . . no big deal . My nerves are getting to me a little today as chemo starts tomorrow . I have my list ... puke bucket for the ride just in case , laptop , cards , dice , mints , kleenex -LRB- just in case there are tears -RRB- . My best girlfriend who is like my sister and I went to see `` My Sister 's Keeper '' ... so after two hours of crying , my eyes were soar ! Hope all goes well for you ! Keep in touch . "
2,TRUE,"Oh Robin , your news just sucks . You are in my constant prayers , and I send lots of gentle bear hugs , white healing light and positive thoughts as you wind your way through the next few days/weeks making a decision . A few thoughts : can Dr. Winer get you into the eribulin trial ?? That 's the new sponge chemo for heavily pre-treated patients that was highly touted at the recent ASCO conference in Chicago . I know he is a wizard and someone you have ultimate trust in . But I thought I would grab at a few straws trying to offer hope . HANG IN THERE SWEET SISTER . We need you here . "
4,FALSE,"Susan , My pain from mast/expander was a dull ache . I only used Tylenol after they disconnected my pain pump before I went home . They tried to give me Percoset but I refused it and I was fine even though I had a 2 + hr . ride home . I only had 30cc put into my expander at surgery time but it was enough to give me a little bump and I was OK with looking at it -LRB- after I got up my nerve and gave myself a little pep talk , it really was OK -RRB- . I also looked at pics on the internet to prepare myself ... that is my best recommendation . Best wishes ! "
2,TRUE,I just had two weeks with relatives from England - lots of fun to be busy and distracted from health issues and kind of tiring . Back to chemo # 4 of 6 tomorrow . Looks like light at the end of the tunnel - and I think it is not a train coming towards me !

6,TRUE,"Bodhi - I am sort of in the same boat . I am currently scheduled for a unilateral mastectomy on Jan. 27 , but if I wait until February I have new insurance that has dramatically better coverage . I am in the process of trying to move everything out ... I was losing it when I first found out all the problems I was about to face -LRB- with insurance -RRB- but am thinking now it was a blessing in disguise . As long as I can tolerate the wait . So , I may be joining the February ladies ! I 've been in the January forum all month . This is such an odd journey ... "
2,TRUE,"Hi Ladies , I did have surgery yesterday , it was delayed from 12:15 til @ 4:30 but all went well , the surgeon was real pleased with everything and he took a little more tissue to be on the safe side and had it quick tested by the on site pathologist and it was negative so that is good news of course . Now of course , the tisue will still be sent out . I came home @ 9:00 and slept til 11:00 am and have felt really good , no pain as of now . So I am so pleased so far , I will get to take the bandages off tomorrow and will get to see the results but hey no matter what it looks like I am still alive and thats all that matters to me . So , I want to thank all of you for your thoughts and prayers it really means a lot to me , and I am so glad to hear that most of you are ending chemo and or rads . I will be starting rads in about a month and it brings much comfort having your post to walk me through this process . Hope everyone has a blessed week and the light at the end becomes brighter for us all and this will all be over soon and life back to better than normal . hugs and blessings to you all , Renee "
0,TRUE,"When I was diagnosed in 2007 , I reacted in the same way you have . Only I did a heck of a lot less research ! I knew I wanted bilateral mastectomies and went ahead with them . The surgery to put in the expanders was tough for me , lots of pain . I had an excellent result , with my breasts looking better than before . I was 37 at the time of my surgery . The only downside ? My cancer came back locally regardless ... I am now finishing up my last week of radiation . I still do not regret my decision , so far the implants still look good . I know I run the risk of a contracture down the road , but I will take one day at a time . Good luck to you ! "
2,TRUE,"Hi everyone , I 've been gone from posting for awhile as my Herceptin treatments have been going well for 4 yrs post Stage IV diagnosis . My MUGA results were mid 50 's for left ventricle ejection fraction every 6 months . Last one was 49 % 6 mos ago and now down to 43 % so my doc stopped the weekly treatments . Who has gone off Herceptin and back on it and how often can this happen ??? Help !!! Just wondering if I pushed exercise and diet during the off time or just rested ??? A friend suggested trying to exercise alot to bring up the numbers and to diet to lose a few pounds but right now I 'm a little depressed about the whole situation !!! Please shed some light on this new quandry for me . Thanks . Pat "
2,TRUE,"OMG , guys , miss a day and miss a lot ! I 'm psyched to watch Skye on TiVo today ! You 've made it sound great , Mel . Rebecca , sorry about the PS stuff . I am a phobe about staying `` in network '' because I hate financial surprises . Viddie , did you say 9 `` weeks '' of herceptin is as good as a year , or did you mean 9 months ? I ca n't imagine how 9 weeks could be equal . A 44 is n't too , too bad . It could well go up on your next MUGA . I 'm not sure they 'll cancel your next tx over it ... or they could postpone . Postponing is fine . It 's not like chemo . How many more months do you have to go on it ? I 'm thinking thru May , like Caya , at least . I was at a much better point when I had my issues , w/only 3 more infusions to go . My onco . said do not worry , you 've had enough ... in other words , if it 's gon na work , it will have by now . And after the heart stuff/near death experience , I really , really feel I have no control over this stuff . Whatever 's gon na happen in my life is gon na happen . This is how I feel now . Ca n't say I always will , but ... If I were you I 'd call your onco . and dicuss what she thinks is best in light of the 44 . My dr. is great about calling back . If yours is not , insist that you need to speak to her directly and STAT as you are having major distress . I know how you feel ... it is unnerving to think you are losing your weapons and if I was at midway point , it would have been a much more difficult decision for me . Oh ! Just remembered one thing : I asked my onc . if I ever needed to go back on H , if I could and he said yes . With heart drugs , my last echo . was 50-55 ... although the tech . secretly told me it was 57 . -LRB- Why all the discrepancy ? -RRB- It 's good though , so I 'm not complaining . I just worry that this figure can fluctuate regularly . "
2,TRUE,"Kbugmom you were one of the first people I met in chat , probably right before or after my dx . You had a light in your spirit I remember well . "
2,TRUE,"Sheila , have you visited a mastectomy store ? I have one camisole which has pockets for pads which were included with the camisole . They have more structure to hold the pad than the shelf style camis . The brand I bought was Amoena , but there are a couple other brands out there . You could wear the one side with the pad and go without on your braless side . I go without the pads and wear the cami to sleep in or when I 'm feeling ultra sensitive and do n't want too much pressure . My insurance covered this purchase and the store took care of the paperwork . I would definitely ask the PS about a script for PT . One thing I did at home after I got my script but before I could get on the PT schedule was to put on some music in my living room and dance by myself . Did n't do anything super fast or any jerky movements , but something with a medium beat that made me want to move . I found that I could move my arms in a variety of motions/angles and let my body be my guide . I did n't force anything , just enjoyed the flow/movement that let me stretch slightly . It 's also a great substitute for walking on rainy days . I think the key is to go easy and do n't do anything that hurts , but I certainly feel a positive light stretch . It never makes me sore afterward , and I think it makes my back feel better as well . I still do it just because I like it . Got ta admit PT pushes me more than I was doing on my own , but it 's good because you know you 're doing things in the right position , how far to stretch , etc. . The second time I went the therapist actually stretched me out as I was lying on a table . I could really feel how tight I am in certain places , esp . in the arm pits . There was some discomfort , but nothing intolerable , and she always made sure she was n't pushing too much . I think the bottom line is that there is going to be some discomfort in order to get back to your starting point . Not pain , but a little effort over time . The therapist has slowly increased the number of exercises I do there and I am supposed to do them on off days at home as well . I went through PT a while back when I broke my foot , so I know that you have to force yourself to do the exercises if you want the full range of motion back . -LRB- The way they tortured me back then does n't even compare to what I 'm doing now , but that was a whole different kind of injury . -RRB- Talk about putting stuff over your head -- it 's a lot easier to get it over than to get it off . A few weeks ago I had to ask some poor clerk at the Target fitting room to come into my room and help me get a shirt off . It was rather embarrassing , because I had taken off my cami and was totally exposed . She was quite nice and kind about the whole thing though . Taught me a lesson though about not forcing things . I still ca n't put tight fitting tops/dresses off and on over my head , but I 'm almost there . Sheila 's method for putting the opening over head first and then one arm at a time works for the bilateral as well , but agree the top has to be looser at first . Kathy , I had no saline placed in my expanders at the time of surgery . My PS said since I am slender , he wants to go slow . First fill was at 4 weeks post surgery and was 60ccs , which is what each fill will be . I go 2-3 weeks between fills and after my final fill will `` rest '' for 4 weeks before exchange surgery . Just got all this info yesterday so I could plan my summer . I have 2 or 3 more fills . Looks like exchange surgery will be Sept. . I sure hope you get those final drains removed next week ! My goodness , it is the one thing that makes you feel human again ! "

0,TRUE,"Hi all , have n't written in awhile . Things have been happening at such a fast pace for me . I had my port put in on Tues. and today started my first chemo treatment . I have to say it was a pleasure to have the port to use , so much less fuss . I got really good news as well . I 'm participating in a clinical trial here in Albany , NY so I was either going to get TAC or TC . It was the luck of the draw . And luck I had as I am only getting the TC , a much milder regime so I 'm very pleased . My chemo session was quite nice . I sat in a heated recliner with a massage mode and had heated blankets placed on me . I read , listened to my ipod , knitted , chatted with my husband , and had some snacks . Sounded easier than what my work day is like . So as long as I do n't get any of the nasty side effects this seems doable to me . Of course I do realize the road ahead will be more challenging but was glad the first step was good . Soon I 'll check into getting a wig and see how I can redo myself with a new look . There has been so much support coming from various people in the community as well as my friends . I 'm just in very positive spirits . I 'll have to refer back to this I 'm sure at a later date when I experience some of the more difficult parts of this . My best wishes to you all . I 'm going to go and read back a couple of days now so sorry for not addressing anyone . Suzanne "

Thankfully we have kids that will keep us going - all the milestones that we will not miss ... we need to be optomistic . Let me tell you what a friend told me last week .

0,FALSE,"I agree with adnerb 's 20/20 hindsight , I think breast cancer is a systemic disease from the get-go . For me , with a high risk precancerous lesion , BPM was my choice .

2,TRUE,"I had a breast mri on Tuesday and received the results today . Have n't spoken with the doctor yet , as I am waiting for a call back . About two months ago I noticed a lumpy area . My doctor called it a `` subtle clump '' or thickening - not a true lump , right inside and above my nipple area . Mammo and US came back normal and FNA came back inconclusive so I was sent for the mri . The results are `` BI-RADS IV -LRB- suspicious -RRB- '' . Then it says : `` there is a large , patchy area of progressive and clumped appearing enhancement positioned at and above the nipple . Questionable ductal appearance or progressive enhancement '' The radiologist recommends an MRI guided biopsy . My question is : they did n't see a cancerous lump so what exactly did they see . Also , what does it mean to have a `` questionable ductal appearance '' . Its a confusing report and does n't seem straight forward at all . Anyone who could shed some light on this would be a big help . I am 40 with three daughters and a mother who was diagnosed with ILC about 6 years ago -LRB- she was post menopausal -RRB- . Also when it says suspicious does it only mean suspicious for cancer or any abnormality . Thanks in adviance . Clare "

Jan and Feb. are usually the coldest so we are probably in for it . Rene , is n't this great ? You have to be in the 40 's . The old below zero is no doubt around the corner . A friend of mine had cancer of the uterus and surgery , no treatment , and this was just before my dx . and her cancer is back in her hip . I am going to call her because I know she is scared . She has no ins . and they took up donations last time for her surg . Our country sucks in health care . We are too busy giving free care , eye glasses and dental work to other countries and thats o.k. but lets take care of our own first . We do n't even take care of our Vets . O.K. I will jump off the soap box . Sorry . I hope everyone had a good New Year day . We went to see I Walk The Line New Years Eve and we went at 4:50 and had dinner resv . at 7:30 . We went to Springfield . My hubby looked at his phone to see the time it was and it was 7 so he went to ask what time the movie got over as we needed to leave by 7:20 to get to the other side of town . The ding bat girl told him the movie was 5 hours so we left at 7:05 . We tell some friends what happened and the movie was 5 hours and laughed at how we could go back tomorrow at 7 and pick up where we left off . Well my hubby looked the movie up on the computer and it got over at 7:20 . The girl musta misplpaced her brain temporarily . I bet everyone we told about the 5 hour movie thinks we are NUTS ! We were telling everyone and just laughing about it . What we saw was good . We can rent it for the last 10 mins . I had lobster so my meal was excellent . We came home and fell asleep by 10:30 . Hubby started his truck driving school today . We use to have ski boats so he and I could both drive a semi . Backing is the hardest part cause the trailer goes opposite of the direction you turn but once you get use to it , it 's not hard . Will I have to listen to country music now ? Maybe we will buy our own `` Big Rig '' . I wont even mention that cause hubby would jump on that . He just thinks I am going to travel with him all the time . UHHHHH not that much . Oh Lordy girls it will be so nice just to have him outta my way for a while . Yea , he worked in his shed a lot and has been doing things around the house and some actually were good but he has just been under foot .

0,TRUE,"Eileen -- I always read , and gain from , your posts . And who is to say exactly which parts of this experience are the most meaningful ? I 'm not doing chemo -- wo n't have to . Or rads .

6,TRUE,"I have no family history of breast/ovarian cancer , but since I was young -LRB- 38 -RRB- at diagnosis , my genetic counselor did agree -LRB- and the insurance as well -RRB- to test for BRCA 1 and 2 -LRB- negative for both -RRB- but I could n't talk them into testing for Lynch . I still think this is the more likely culprit , in my case , since there is a lot of colon cancer on mom 's side of the family , but they just wo n't do it . Both the counselor and geneticist said breast cancer is not one of the cancers seen in lynch syndrome . Most of my reading and research seems to state otherwise , though ... So , I 'm in the same boat as you . For now , I 'm letting it go , but I might start insisting on the testing again in a few years . Maybe they will change their minds , or maybe there will be a different counselor/geneticist with different views . I DID make sure I got my colonoscopy at 40 , though . "
6,TRUE,It is unbelievable to me that so many of us are all in the same boat . I was diag in Sept 2010 had a lumptecomy with clear nodes and margin . Waiting for my oncotype dx test to come back this week to find out if I need chemo or not . I do n't like the waiting game .

2,TRUE,"Ulla , I 'm so happy for you ! I had no idea you were so close to finishing up your chemo ! Do you have to do radiation or hormonal meds or anything else ? Anyway , congratulations a few days early ! TeasKaren , the taxotere really affected my sense of taste and not in the ways i expected . For me , most sweet things , even fruit , tasted awful . I usually drink Pepsi One , and that did n't taste good either , but ginger ale continued to taste OK . Some veggies were OK , others not . Potatoes in general were n't good . Basically , the only things that tasted OK most of the time were cheese , crackers and pickles . Not exactly a healthy diet , but since it was for a limited time , I decided not to worry about it . The good news is that my taste is pretty much back to normal now since I 've finished the treatments , so do n't worry , it 's not permanent . On a general note , now that I 'm over 3 weeks past my last TC treatment , the watery eyes seem to be clearing up , slowly but surely . Also , I 'm gradually starting to get more energy back . I think this whole experience has given me some permanent changes though . I 've found that the forced down times that I took turned out to be very precious to me -LRB- and to my cat , I must add ! -RRB- , so I plan to continue some of them on a regular basis even as I feel better .

As far as chemo goes , I had dose dense AC+TH -LRB- assuming you 've already learned the alphabet soup of chemo drugs . -RRB- It was not fun but also not as bad as I was expecting . Take all the drugs they give you . Get a port and save yourself a year of IV starts for Herceptin . I was glad to have it . Try to let other people take care of you .

0,TRUE,"I have just been to the surgeon , 1 week after lumpectomy . 2cm tumour , clear margins , no node involvement but it 's a freaking stage 3 . Also not hormonal responsive but HER2 responsive . So meeting an Oncologist in 1 week to discuss the chemo regime and will be going on herceptin , then radiation . FECK ! At least I have a plan now , I feel strangely calmer now even though I know it 's a hard road ahead , but as the surgeon said to me - still very treatable and herceptin is supposed to do wonders . FECK !!! It 's all overwhelming . Been 3 weeks since initial dx and so much has happened . But it 's good it 's all moving along quickly . I just want this done , throw the kitchen sink at me -LRB- I 'm sure I wo n't be saying that during treatment -RRB- but I want to be here in the next 10,20,30 , 40 years damn it .

4,TRUE,"Dear Other Half , Welcome to a great group . Today my husband was home to receive the final pathological report from the surgeon . My mastectomy was last week and we we 're waiting for the final path report . I had two areas of DCIS as well as the one grade 3 , small tumor . The mastectomy was totally our decision and both my husband and I are glad we made the decision . Even though all margins came back clear and all the cancer has been caught , just knowing that we can share the rest of lives together with the smallest chance of it returning is a true blessing . Life is full of challenges and together you will make it through . My husband and I have been married 23 years and have raised two beautiful daughters . This may be one of the most difficult roads we 've traveled together , but having him there for the ride has made the journey much easier . Keep your faith and love and live your life to the fullest ! Hope to hear more of you both ... Roxi "
4,FALSE,"OMG ! I 'm so glad that it 's not only me . I thought for sure i was going crazy with all this , I ca n't to look at a box of wheat thins that 's what i ate at my first chemo just the sight makes me want to barf . I ca n't stand the way that my bathroom smells , I put clorox all the time and the smell is still there . We are going to take out the tile and put new tile and toilet when i 'm done with chemo on sept 24th . But still have 52 weeks of herceptin , should i wait since Mary Jo says that she still smells it . Another thing i wanted to mention was when I was on A/C the mosquitos would never attack me and now that i 'm on toxatere they are eating me alive ! I wonder if we ever get ride of the smells that bring back our horrible memories . Sure hope so gals "
0,TRUE,"Good Morning Jewels , Again , I am amazed at all that 's been posted since yesterday ... KathyL and SheShe48-Shocking that a pediatrics office-an office that deals with medicine - can be so discompassionate to one of its own nurses . SheShe48-same to you ... a BC Survivor fired you ? I do n't think that 's even legal ... firing someone on the spot for disclosing they were diagnosed with cancer . -LRB- Not that I 'm advocating filing a wrongful termination suit - who would want to work for someone like that anyway -RRB- . I feel for you both on the tightening finances . I am sooooo lucky to work in my school district . We have a Catestrophic Leave bank that we donate to each year . I applied to be granted enough leave to get me through the end of the school year . I am awarded 20 days at a time , and have been told there is enough to get me to the end of the year plus plenty of days for others in our district who may need it . Once that is done , if I need more time , my disability insurance will kick in at 75 % of my pay . Kathy , I hear you about all the germs and being on your feet all day long . As a teacher , I 'm in the same boat . Parents send their sick ones to school all the time , and I often do n't get to sit all day long - except during my 36 minute lunch , if I take lunch as I often give up lunch to assist kids who need help - having 5 periods and over 130 + students in and out of the classroom . I had to take the rest of the year off ... and it killed me ... I miss my kids so much ... but I had to put my well-being first . D1-Not only is FUBC totally appropriate ... but FUSE -LRB- F. . U. . . Side . . Effects -RRB- too !!!! You crack me up ... even when you 're feeling like the Vikings snapped you the ball and let the other team trample all over you . I often say to the TV ... like it can hear me ... when pharmaceutical companies advertise their wares ... `` How can you put on that smile and do whatever it is you 're doing with all those SE 's ? '' Notice the SE 's are stated quickly in the background like we wo n't notice . Who can function at all , let alone have sex , with a four hour erection , loss of hearing , and eyesight ? And those SE 's for the CMF chemotini sound dreadful ... of course , not everyone experiences these SE 's ... and they have to be disclosed ... but that 's scary shit ... oops , sorry ... it just slipped out ... must be an SE of BC . Vettegal-I hear you on being impatient ... and agree with all the advice/support already given . I had nodes removed on the left side at the same time as my bilat , and healing is slow , but it does get better little by little and day by day . Hang in there ... oh , you ca n't do that yet -LRB- neither can I now that I mentioned it -RRB- ... ummm ... Stiff upper lip dahling ... you 've got the right stuff !!! Love the T-Shirt idea .

That 's great !!!! My father is working with a group to restore an old WWII tugboat from Pearl Harbor . He was in Hawaii when it was bombed-he was 5 - and his father was a civil engineer hired by the govt to do things like work on the Panama Canal and stuff . Anyway , my dad feels his father may have been on this tug as he toured the damage and worked on a plan to clear away all the wreckage and repair docks and the like . My mother , who passed away at 58 of Pancreatic Cancer , was a wonderfully funny lady . She often stated that when she retired she wanted to be a poet truckdriver . Hee Hee . Sorry to hear your mom passed of melonoma . Anyway , I 'm with you on making 2008 the year I show the world what this gal is made of ... let 's kick butt this year !!!!! Sharon-Thanks for the info on Neupogen and Nuelasta . I know I 'm supposed to get a shot of something the next day after chemo ... but ca n't recall the name of it . Still have n't heard from my oncologists office ... I 'm thinking they took today off and will do the same tomorrow . Welcome Julie K and Chris . You 've found a great group here . Julie , I am 99 % positive that I 'll be getting a hysterectomy and have my ovaries removed , which is apparently not included in a hysterectomy -LRB- uterus only , I believe -RRB- in order to reduce my likelihood of ovarian cancer . My dad had breast cancer and prostate cancer -LRB- still living -RRB- , and my mother pancreatic cancer -LRB- passed at 58 -RRB- , and all of those cancers are tied to the BRCA2 gene ... so Dad 's taken the BRCA test as of last week-my insurance wo n't cover it because we do n't have enough cancer in the family line ... go figure - If he 's positive , then insurance has to cover my test ... but more importantly , my twin will have no problems getting her test approved . I already did a bilateral mastectomy-which is one choice my oncologist would have strongly suggested had the test results been in hand prior to surgery ... and I 'm glad I did have a bilat ... the right breast did have precancerous cells roaming around . Now , the test will determine if I have all my female plumbing removed , since my cancer is ERPR + . Sounds like your family history is full of this dreaded disease , too . I 'm sorry your family has had to go down this road . Has your sister regretted her decision to remove her breasts and female plumbing ? My twin is a bit unnerved by this whole thing ... to be expected . I think I 've gotten everyone ... if not ... know I 'm thinking about you and wishing you nothing but dreamfilled nights , energy filled days , and clear headed minds :--RRB- By the way , Charlie Wilson 's War , was FABULOUS !!!! It 's amazing what this man did ... and how we find ourselves in the same position again ... doing the same thing we 've always done only this time without a man like Charlie on the team . When will our gov ' t learn from its mistakes ? I read the Kite Runner , YuYuBear , and hear the movie is really good ... but I loved the book so much and do n't want to spoil what I imagined in my head ... and heard the movie gives too much away too soon . I 'll have to wait and see if I can bring myself to go see it . I 'm a little weird when it comes to my characters in what I read ... I literally have to grieve the end of a book ... I ca n't pick up another for a day or two ... OK , that 's a lot weird . Happy New Year Jewels ... tonight at the stroke of midnight , I 'll be toasting us all !!!!

6,TRUE,"hi fellow cruisers , I hope this boat does n't make me sea sick like I was on Uncle Sam 's Navy Wives cruise many years ago ! I am 51 years old and I start chemo Feb 15th ... my husband shaved his head to support me and gave his hair to Locks of Love . I got my long hair cut the very next day to a very short spiked cut but it was n't quite long enough for Locks of Love . I actually like it now I 'm getting used to it . I will be taking Emend then a cocktail of Adriamycin and Cytoxan 4 doses 3 weeks apart then radiation treatments then Tamoxifin for 5 years . I had a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy in November in my left breast and he found I had stage 0 in a lobal area non invasive cancer .7 cm . Got a second opinion on treatments and changed to a female surgeon . She ordered an MRI for both breasts and found a suspicious spot in my right breast with it and an ultrasound . The spot was n't in any of my mamo 's . She did a needle biopsy and it was invasive ductal cancer 1.5 cm . I already had a lumpectomy and sentinal node checked for spread about 2 weeks ago . The node came back clean and I had clear margins with the invasive cancer . Now chemo is next to help half my chance of reaccuring breast cancer . After reading these forums and lurking for awhile I just joined up to chat with y' all . I 've already gotten a few things to help with eating during chemo thanks to these great and helpful ladies info here . I am hoping for some support from you gals especially on the bad days . Interesting seeing all the nurses here , I worked as a nurses aide for 8 years in nursing homes . Jan "

5,TRUE,"Just wanted to say hi , I joined the train on Sunday right after finishing chemo this past Friday . I start radiation in a month . I 've read lots of this board and just wanted to say I feel for all those who had to make the decision to take tamoxifen and thus not have anymore children . I 'm 36 and was Dx in the 5th month of my pregnancy - I started chemo then had a beautiful baby boy right before a lumpectomy and lymph node removal . He was supposed to be the first child in our family and it was tough for me to buy off on 5 years of tamoxifen but I need to be around to raise our son . I 'll look for you all in the chocolate car !

6,TRUE,"My mom was in the same boat , she had her hysterectomy in the late 70 's took hormones until her dx in 2001 . After her dx , they took her off her hormones and she took tamox for 5 yrs . Sheila "
4,FALSE,"Janie -- I had my first Herceptin on November 15th , 2004 . It started out with the nurse not being able to get blood to come back in my PICC line in my arm . SO they tried a whole bunch of different ways for me to sit and stand and twist , but nothing worked . Then they got the Nurse Anesthe . who had put the PICC line in my arm to try . She had me lie down on a bed and they tipped the bed backwards so that I was like standing on my head and then she Jerked on my arm and HERE came the blood . So then I had to be tipped slowly back up and lie there for awhile before I could stand up cuz all the blood was in my head !! Interesting experience . Then I had the MEGA dose of 335 mg over 90 minutes with all the wires and machines attached to see if I was going to be ok . I got flu like symptoms right away , but this was just one week away from my last Taxol so I was still dealing with that dreadful stuff . I should back up and say that I had a Groshong Cath in my chest placed during mascectomy 4/22/04 . In October I developed a staph infection in the cath and drove 160 miles round trip morning and night for 2 weeks/28 doses of Vancomyacin to try to save the cath due to my long treatment schedule . The Vanco gave me `` Red Man 's Syndrome '' the first time so they slowed down the infusion and it took 3 hours each time instead of 1 hour . SIGH . It was a long two weeks and it did n't work so on 10/26/04 I had surgery to remove my Groshong . I had 3 blessed days of `` nothing on my body that I did n't start out with '' and then on 10/29/04 I had a PICC line placed in my arm so that I could have my next Taxol on November 1st . Then I had my `` Week from Hell '' as I named it as if a bunch of the preceding weeks had n't been but on Monday 11/8 I had my last Taxol . YAY ! On Tuesday 11/9 I drove 225 miles to a big hospital to have my 3rd MUGA . That night after driving 225 miles back home , I drove the 85 miles up to the hospital where I have my chemo each week . I stayed in a motel that night and on Wednesday , 11/10 I went into the hospital for my Port placement . So I had a PICC line and a port at the same time . They would n't let me drive back to the motel after the surgery so I left my Jeep in the hospital parking lot and one of my chemo nurses gave me a ride to the motel . She also came back that night and checked on me to see it I was comfortable and taking my pain meds . She 's an angel . On Thursday , 11/11 I walked over to the hospital from the motel and had my bandages removed from the port 24 hours after the surgery . I was left with steri-strips that I had to leave on for a week . Then I stole my Jeep out of the parking lot and went back to the motel . On Friday , 11/12 I had my monthly appt . with my Oncologist . He told me that I was past the `` bad part '' and it should be smooth sailing now . He told me that I did n't have to take any premeds for the Herceptin . He could n't believe the bruising due to the port placement and on my arm from the MUGA and around the PICC . And the reason for the PICC was that they had to wait for my chest to heal on the left side from the removal of the Groshong before they could put in the Port-a-Cath and they wanted the port to be able to heal before they used it . On Saturday , a couple of friends drove up and rescued me from the motel . I got home and spent the rest of Sat . and Sun . taking pain pills and then Monday , 11/15 I had my first Herceptin . So I was somewhat whimped out at the time and I thought that was why it affected me the way it did . I also got some really bad bloody noses after the first treatment , but I still think this was left over from the Taxol . It has gotten better , but I still get the sneezes and sniffles and sometimes a rash on my feet . It is worst on Tuesday and Wednesday . I got my PICC line out on 11/29 after they successfully used the port for the first time . I LOVE the port . I just wish I 'd had the option to have it inserted in the first place , then I would n't have had the whole Vanco oddessy , but WHATEVER . I just had Herceptin 29 on Monday with ONLY 23 to go !! My RBC/Hemoglobin is back up to 12.2 so I did n't have to have my every other week Arenesp shot this time . I 've had to have Arenesp shots a couple of other times in the Herceptin part . It must have done its job this time , but my WBC and my lymphs are still on a downward roll . I see my oncologist tomorrow morning so we are going to discuss that issue . SIGH . In rare cases Herceptin can mess with blood counts and I won in that category I guess . I feel really good now that the anemia is gone , but I just have to avoid `` sick people '' and stay heathy myself . My mindset has been that I HAD breast cancer and they took it away from me surgically . Now I 'm doing adjuvant therapy to make sure that I never have it again . This got longer that I meant it to be , but that 's my last kinda 7 or 8 months in a `` nut shell '' . My welcome to all the June newbies too . I got ta get ready for work -- It hailed here last night for about half an hour and I can look out the window and see my poor Jeep sitting out there all covered with leaves from my trees . I 'm half scared to look closely . I bet I 've got some dents . Oh , well , it 's old and beat up like me !! Hope you all have a great Thursday . Smiles -- NancyLee "
6,TRUE,"No , no , no , Cindy ! Bite your tongue ! First of all , a cure for cancer could be a moment away . Say you do have recurrence or mets , life can often be prolonged in each case with treatment . Maybe life can be prolonged just long enough to slip you the cure . I know everybody has to die of something , but like so , so many people I 've had family who have died of cancer . I watched my grandmothers and my brother die of cancer . I really would prefer I get a different destiny and I 'm going to hold out for that . That said , I often feel the same way . A friend of mine -LRB- who does n't have any health problems -RRB- says `` We are all in the same boat . '' I feel like well , maybe , but I 'm sitting closer to the exit . Now listen to me . LOL . What a rollercoaster ride . OK . My friend 's stepmother had Stage 4 bc . I do n't know whether she was triple neg or not , but Stage 4 mets to bones . The doctors told her they could n't do much more , but she could try a something along the lines of transplanting bone marrow -LRB- I think that 's what it is -RRB- , anyway , it was over $ 50,000 . She said forget it , joined the Hemlock Society , and moved away to a new house with her husband - 14 years ago . A few years ago she almost died of a heart infection , they revived her , and gave her antibiotics . She 's doing great . She loves yoga and gardening . Travels a lot . True story . "
4,TRUE,"Hi everyone . I had a lumpectomy performed last week , and my surgeon told me at the time that the sentinel lymph node was clean , which was a relief . Today , however in my my post-op visit , I learned that in the surrounding tissue of the the lump they removed -LRB- 1.5 cm/2 .5 cm -RRB- , they discovered a node and tested it . The location of the node was n't common . Well , the node tested positive for suspicious cell activity , and now I am scheduled to have an MRI done . So , now I 'm freaking out because it seems like most people have the MRI before their surgeries , and I 'm having it afterwards . Has this happened to anyone here ... and if so , what rollercoaster ride can I look forward to ? Before the discovery of the uncommon node , my treatment looked like radiation only , but now it is pretty much decided that I will have to undergo chemo as well . I ca n't help thinking that an MRI at this stage means that the cancer , which was once thought to have been removed from the lumpectomy , is now going to be something far worse . "

This whole situation has been more than I ever thought it would be . It has blown my mind how this cancer has grown so fast . I have had several healing issues and infections . I just had my 5th surgery and I am undergoing chemo . I have 4 more drains and am hopeful that this time my wounds will heal . I am looking forward to getting this behind me . I have had a bumpy ride also and understand how overwhelming it can feel . Good luck and I am here if you need someone to talk to .

2,TRUE,"I have not posted here in a long time . I was diagnosed with stage IIB in 2005 and this discussion forum was my lifeline for several years after my diagnosis . My older sister was diagnosed with stage IIB in 2004 . I am concerned because my sister is in the hospital for acute diareha and vomiting . They ca n't figure out what is wrong with her and I fear the worse . They did a scan and I assume did not find anything or at least that is what my sister is saying and they now want to do an emergency colonoscopy while she is in the hospital . I know that breast cancer does not normally spread to the colon but does spread to the liver ; however , her symptoms do not necessarily indicate spread to the liver and I assume the scans do not show liver involvement either . Is it possible that she has a new primary tumor which is actually colon cancer . I was reading that women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are at an increased risk for colon cancer . Has anyone heard that before . I would like to hear from anyone who could shed some light and possible calm my worst fears for my sister . "
0,FALSE,"Jeano , good tip about the thyroid . . maybe I 'll have a test -LRB- if I can possibly make myself have another blood test -RRB- .

He showed me all around his positively amazing finished projects -LRB- including a fish-smoker with an underground updrafting pipe from the fire to the hanging fillets in the smoking chamber -RRB- and his carefully hand-made kitchen benches . He was a little weird -LRB- apart from his fascinating English accent and Touretty conversation -RRB- . . he had a kind of ` chemo-lapse ' in his phrasing and waddya know ? He has cancer . He has a really rare blood cancer and collapsed immune system , and has chemo every month . He is in remarkable shape -LRB- he is 62 -RRB- and I think is taking most positive approach to whatever time he has left . He talked so emphatically about living life ` in this exact moment ' . We had so many laughs . He asked me if I minded talking about ` this stuff ' , and pointed out that he has no-one else to talk to about it , except doctors . Interesting , is n't it ? I think we will be good friends , and Drew can take him out in the tinny , which he will love . We are all just about one year out from chemo -LRB- my last date was Sept 26th -RRB- .

Of course being in Massachusetts I have to worry about snow , sleet and Ice . I told them I do n't like to drive in that type of weather , I am 32 miles from the Radiation center . The Rad Onc told me that she does not expect her patients to risk life and limb or end up in a snow drift on the highway for a precautionary treatment , so if the roads are bad I should stay home and my finish time will just be extended . How nice is that ! I had a Bi-lat mast in June , had 4 treatments of T&C and am on Femara . Blood work of two weeks ago were perfect numbers . "
4,TRUE,"Thanks Sunny . I had a choice of rads to try to shrink the tumor which at the time they thought was 5-6cm , or go ahead and have mastectomy , Since the tumor was so close to my nipple and lumpectomy really was n't possible unless it shrunk considerably , I chose mastectomy . Will have chemo and then right Prophylactic -LRB- sp -RRB- mastectomy and reconstruction on both sides when chemo is over . This ia a crazy roller coaster ride we are on !! "
0,TRUE,"Sounds like everyone is doing well . To answer what I got filled . On Tuesday I had my first fill on my tissue expanders . I had a bmx with / te and I am now starting the filling process . I was given the clear by all doctors that I could do both the fills and chemo at the same time . So I started my chemo rounds -LRB- only 3 more to go -RRB- as well , last week . I guess you could say I am not waiting at all . I am hoping for no complications and a smooth road , or as smooth as it can be so that I can get through this journey . Once chemo is done I have to wait at least one month for the exchange for the new implants . So I will be done in May and hopefully the exchange will happen sometime in July . So I will have new hair and new girls for the fall . I just really want to get to the other side of this whole thing . I know that we all do .

I am going to PT and doing lots of massage and exercise , not sure it helps much .

I am still wearing a girdle , but in my situation , the muscle is cut , so the girdle is a must . Down the road I will find out if a hernia or an abdominal wall weakness is an issue . Go back to the ps in 2 months for a consult -LRB- to next step in this recon process -RRB- , and will see then if I will need a repair .

They 're fatty but my Onc said whatever you can get down is good enough . What I also found was that meats like chicken and hamburger and steak also tasted fairly normal . I had the most trouble with cheese and milk and stuff like that . Bread tasted weird too . The whole bad taste thing is really difficult . I also found that Crystal Light lemonade tasted fairly normal as well because water just tasted like tin and I could n't get it down . I hope you do find some things that taste at least close to OK for you !! "

4,TRUE,Hi Jessica - so glad you found us ... no one should go through this alone ! Where are you getting treatment ? I am at Swedish . I started off on TC -LRB- without the H -RRB- as well and got switched to CMF becuase of terrible reaction on # 2 . What a rollercoaster ride ! The get togehter on Wednesday is only our 2nd time meeting -LRB- I think ? -RRB- but we had so much fun the first time I am sure there will be other opportunities ! Good luck tomorrow !
4,TRUE,"Gosh I need to bitch ... I had my first MRI 2 weeks ago I am 1 year post lumpectomy and mamosite radiation along with Arimidex . The MRI highlighted 1 suspicious area in each breast . . Had first biopsy on my lumpectomy side , Dr. called last night to say it was a reoccurance and it was because my Mamosite radiation had failed . Then she called me today to say that the final pathology is hard to read might not be cancer at all and it was sent to a breast pathologist ... I have my second biopsy on the `` good breast '' tomorrow . What a smuckin roller coaster ride if I did n't have a stash of valium I think I would need a straight jacket LOL . well thats my bitchin for today . "
2,FALSE,"Good morning all , Work has calmed down , so I can come and breathe and send a nice , long chatty note to all my fellow February chemo cruisers . Leah -- Buon viaggoio ! I love Italy ... I visited Venice and Florence one Christmas holiday season with my younger sister . She had done a junior semester abroad in London and I was working in England , so Italy was close . My sister was minoring in Art History , so I had my own personal guide ! Carynn -- Sometimes it is nice when husbands go away ... but , it 's nicer when they come back !! Piper -- Congrats on your successful second surgery . Somehow my calendar keeping has fallen by the wayside . I did have a giggle thinking about the syringes on your nipples !! Jan -- My secret pal has been much more devious -- obviously someone who 's played this game before ! Terry -- I had my rads onc follow-up visit this week as well . He says that he does not normally recommend MRIs , but does recommend them for me given my presentation and history . However , he never recommends an MRI until at least one year after the end of rads . Apparently , there is still a lot of radiation damage inside that lights up on the MRI . Which is exactly what happened to me , cause my chemo onc had me do an MRI about six weeks after rads was over ! SammieKay -- I 'm so sorry to hear about your painful expanders . How much more do they need to add ? When is your exchange surgery ? I must admit , I have to laugh hearing about 600 cc of saline . My boobs are so small , that if I were to do bilat and reconstruction , I think that 60 cc would just about do it - LOL ! Marsha , Marsha , Marsha -- How are you doing ???? We miss you ... I hope that you are feeling all of our virtual hugs ! Twilah -- I 'm sure that you 're looking forward to getting your last chemo done . Are you drinking enough fluids ? I seem to remember that 's what did us all in the first time around -- we got too cocky by the third one and forgot to force liquids ! Melanie , Terry , Jel , Alyson , Karen , Catherine -LRB- and anyone I 've missed -RRB- -- Sounds like we are all getting on with life , and rolling with the ride . I , unfortunately , do n't do well on rollercoasters -- I even get sick on the baby ones I used to have take my son on . So , I 'm really hoping for a smooth ride . The wierdness about the MRI results has tested my reserve to remain calm . I 'm deliberately trying to focus on the fact that my chest X-ray was clear and my right boob was clear . Everyone tells me to ignore the results on the left breast . Of course , as my rads onc put it , now that we have these results , we have to follow them up . So , I will be checked more than usual for the next year . Now that work has calmed down , I 've got some time to reflect on life and think about what I really want to be doing . I see this as an opportunity to take stock and have a well-organized mid-life crisis ! I 'm still frustrated by aphasia and general forgetfulness . I ca n't blame it on tamoxifen or AIs , so it 's either prolonged chemo-brain -LRB- quite possible -RRB- or the affect of being abruptly dropped into menopause . Whatever the reason , it is frustrating not be at the top of my game , so to speak . Hugs to all , Hillary "

2,TRUE,"I agree with mmm5 about the ovarian ablation being as or almost as effective as tamoxifen on its own . You had both , kind of like a `` back-up '' -- many women only get one or the other . My onc is looking at tamox only OR ovarian suppression -LRB- lupron -RRB- with an AI on me , leaning toward the latter . I do n't know if tamox with the addition of lupron is just more common outside the US , or if this is just my onc 's view . But yes , thank your lucky stars that you were on both at the same time ! The hot flashes you were having might not have been from the tamox at all . The lupron that suppressed your estrogen production and hence put you in `` menopause '' probably would have also caused hot flashes -LRB- jsut like when you are on chemo and in a chemically-induced menopause -RRB- Either way , the fact that you had hot flashes , regardless of which drug caused them , is good news because it most likely means your estrogen level was LOW . Most of your estrogen production would have been eliminated by the lupron . The only bit left would have been the small amount that the fat & adrenal glands make . Maybe the tamox was able to intervene enough for that small amount . Switching to an AI will take care of that extra estrogen as well , but I would definately switch to the AI asap in light of this new news ! "
6,TRUE,"I want to thank all of you , again , for your positive energy and well wishes . And , I have a bit if a problem that requires many heads . We saw the oncologist yesterday , who has presented us with possible treatment options , now that the bilat is complete and the staging is done . I have already rejected chemo as , given my cardiac health , going through that will risk more compromise to my heart muscle than benefit -LRB- only 6 % -RRB- me in protecting against recurrence . Here are the numbers for a field of 100 women iin my age group , with my stage and grade , etc. , of cancer : No treatment : 65 % alive with no recurrence after 10 years ; 24 % recurrence ; 11 % died of other causes . With Hormonal Therapy : 77 % alive with no recurrence after 10 years -LRB- an increase of only 12 % -RRB- ; 12 % recurrence ; 11 % died of other causes . I am already taking medications for my cardiac care that have the potential for muscle/joint pain and liver problems . I am concerned about introducing another drug that will create more of the same potential . And , I am concerned about having to take a handful of other meds to offset side effects and possible muddy the waters even more . The doctor said that if the Arimadex created problems for me he would put me on Tamoxifen -- not something I want to do , either and certainly not a drug that I thought would be prescribed for me at my postmenopausal stage and age -LRB- 61 -RRB- . We know this is my decision , and I am going to see my GP next week and consult with her as well as do more research before we decide . But , I want to know from you , those who are in this little boat with me , what you are thinking about and what you have decided . Also , any input or words of wisdom will be most appreciated . "
2,FALSE,"ginger - Nope , they are not temporary . Some women decline them for religious reasons . I think they just look like freckles . As I understand , they `` mark '' the boundaries of the radiation field . Then the technician lines up a shining light on the area to be radiated . It has to be very accurate . I think the reason they give you permanent freckle tatooes is because once radiated , they can NEVER radiate this area again -LRB- I do n't know about chest x-rays -RRB- . If ever there was a recurrence of BC , they would know where you had been radiated before . I love my Rads Onc . he 's smart , cute and funny . I 'll try to find out more and share . "

6,TRUE,I 'm in the same boat as you . I 've tried all the hormonals and chemo is my only choice now too . I have the mets in my bone marrow -LRB- and bones -RRB- so I 'm always fighting blood counts after chemo . I 've had several whole blood transfusions and a platelet transfusion too . Ca n't really remember the lowest the platelet count was when they did chemo but I know it was above 50 . Whenever I get a transfusion my counts are good enough to get chemo the next week . Hang in there !
6,FALSE,"Hello , Divas ! I jumped on the Femara train this weekend . As I have had really horrible se 's -LRB- and secondary se 's -RRB- from chemo -LRB- TC -RRB- and had to stop early , my doctor and I have agreed that I should start slowly and work my way up . So , I started by taking 1/2 pill on Friday , so as it 's Monday , have only had 2 full doses . Weird foot pain on Saturday night , but that could have been anything . Already been doing the hot flashes since February when I stopped taking HRT after we found the lump and I was dx 'd , so nothing new there . Already on Prilosec for acid reflux , so if there are any stomach issues with cutting the pills , I have n't seen those either . I started taking fish oil and Vit . D , and calcium , plus an antioxidant vitamin prior to starting on Femara , and have been taking Biotin since end of April to get my hair growing -LRB- it 's trying -RRB- . Biggest thing I guess is I need to get MSM -LRB- what is that ? -RRB- and Glucosamine to help with the joints . Also , restarted my yoga this weekend , and boy did those stretches feel good - first time in 6 months I really stretched anything ! I plan on upping my walking , and we 've been getting more bicycle time in , and plan to do this a couple of times a week too . I guess after about a week or so on 1/2 doses I 'll try to up it to a regular full dose , unless you ladies have gotten any research that just doing the half tab is fine - then I plan to stay right where I am . I am nervous of the pain / stiffness se 's , as my job entails me to be very physical at times , I am a marketing manager for a boat builder , and I need to do photo shoots , set up boat shows and events , etc. , and I am fearful that this could interfere and not allow me to work !

0,TRUE,"Wow ... so many replies . Thank you all so much !!! I appreciate the information and the knowledge from the route you took . I 'm so ready to talk to an Oncologist . I have so many questions and need those answers to make my decision . I will say , that I am a worrywart so I think the possibility of waiting on a recurrence is scary . Right now , I would rather deal with the mastectomy . I do n't want it to come back invasive and have to go thru it all again and perhaps it be even worse . I 'm younger and could probably deal with the surgery now than later down the road . I 'm a little afraid that if I say I want a mastectomy , that they will thinks its overkill for a 4mm . The fact that it is high grade is what is pushing me towards the mx . Will the doctors try to persuade me not to ? I 'm considering going thru with the lumpectomy next week to get those path reports . But then , if they get clean margins and I say I still want a mx will they not want to do it ? I just do n't know what to do . Do I cancel the surgery and wait to speak to an oncologist ? My anxiety level is thru the roof and I want to have this awful cancer removed from my body . I want to have the lumpectomy next week for that very reason . Then I feel like there is time to decide what to do next . Am I wrong ? I know they say DCIS is slow growing but is it really when it 's high grade ? It had been 1 year and 8 months between mammos for me and it showed up in that time period . I do n't have an Oncologist yet . I guess after the lumpectomy I would be referred to one ? I 'm a little confused on the entire process . Should I call my surgeon now and ask who he was going to recommend ? Do I go with recommendation ? How do I know who 's the best ? How do I know I 'm headed in the right direction ? "

It is important not to get in the sun cause as it fades the sun can make it permanent dark mark so knowing how you feel about that just make sure afterwords from now on you protect that area with a sun screen . My brown marks haved faded , but you can outline if you look careful enough to see where the tx was . I would rather have you with a red mark and alive than buried without any marks .

As you progress in RT tx your skin in that area will feel like a sun burn ... just remember how a sunburn feels and you do n't want to put hot water and soap on it . It dries it out more .

0,TRUE,Hi PMoore ... So sorry you had to join this club ... . I would think they will decide chemo later after an Oncotype DX test is done if you are node negative ... This test will show if you will benefit from chemo or not ... My score was 11 so no chemo for me ... I had DCIS grade 2 AND IDC grade 1 ... It also depends on the STAGE you are in ... . The more advanced the stage the more likely you will have chemo ... Also if you are HER2 Positive you will proba by do chemo also plus Herceptin . . There are numerous variables when deciding chemo or not as you can see ... I wish you well and much luck on your surgery and pathology ... . I wish you low stage and no node involvement ... ... I was 43 when I was diagnosed and am now almost 46 ... It has been a long road for me but it was doable ... I also had a bilat mast with immediate TRAM recons ... ... Good luck ... ...

0,TRUE,"jackieb11-I understand how you are feeling ! I had a right mastectomy on June 13th and had my last fill 3 weeks ago . Most of the time I had 100cc 's put in at one time and paid for the 3 to 4 day back , rib , and spine pain afterwards . Sometimes I could n't walk , sit or stand comfortably . When I had a couple 50cc fills the pain was tolerable but then I kept thinking about how much longer it would take to get the fills over with . I just wanted to get it done . I too went back to work full-time , but I am able to move around alot and find that stretching every hour really helps with the stiffness . I am scheduled for my exchange surgery in October . If the pain continues to be a problem your PS can remove some of the saline and you can have it replaced slower over a bit more time . I have also found that the discomfort has decreased considerably for about a week know . I think my body has started to accept the stretching process . Also , do n't be afraid to take your pain medicine and your PS can also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxer . Hang in there . It will get better . As far a coping with the journey through all of this - I try to keep myself really busy so I do n't have time to think about what may be in the far away future . Just take each day at a time and do n't overwhelm yourself with everything that may happen down the road . I try and look at the light at the end of this tunnel as the upcoming exchange surgery .

Two weeks and I want to hit the road and I think he wants to hit me . And this is just the beginning ... I myself have just 2 little words to say `` Be Nice '' Please that 's all we want . Just treat us as though we are a little bit special . Everyone seems to be under the impression that I have had like a mole removed or a tooth pulled - you know the tumour 's out so get back to normal but it 's not that simple . I am very grateful that the surgeon could do a lumpectomy and I get to keep my breast but this is cancer not an abcess and this is what no-one on the outside seems to get . And then for me the worse is that my husband is n't what one would call a ` boob man ' - so seeing as he is not that into breasts that makes it all that much worse for me . I wish sometimes that if the cancer was somewhere else he might be different . I alsoget so pissed off and angry and think that I wo n't even bother with the rest of the friggen treatment and maybe it would be best if nature just takes it 's toll and then I wo n't be in anybody 's way and I wo n't feel so sad anymore . My husband is a biker -LRB- BMW K1200GT -RRB- and we went for a ride on Saturday with our 25 year old son . It was great -LRB- but my oncologist said to me no alcohol and I have n't had any and it does n't bother me any -RRB- - but then he gets like all funny because I wo n't order a cider - a little ca n't do any harm he says .

0,TRUE,"I am early stage and on hormonals . I was premeno and even went on Lupron during chemo to protect my ovaries because hubby and I wanted a baby . All that went out the window when I came back a poor Tamox metabolizer and had to have the ovaries out .

My QOL has been good . I am starting to feel achey and stiff but nothing that I ca n't live with . My problem is that the results from my bone density scan were given to me by me gyno today and I have severe osteopenia in all parameters and osteoporosis in the lumbar region of my spine . Am I 37 or 87 ? Anyway she said that I have to go on an osteo drug and gave me Boniva to start taking but I think when I see my onco next month I will ask about starting Zometa . This all really sucks . BC blows . The good news is that the bone loss is reversable with the meds so I guess there is a silver lining . It does not change my mind on the hormonals , though . These drugs have proven to prevent reoccurence and I want all that I can get . I wear my seat belt in the car to give me a chance in case of an accident so I see my hormonal as my BC seat belt . I do not want to go through BC again . I do n't want to regret the road not travelled . Just my opinion though and it is how I can live comfortably . Not right for everyone I know and probably should n't be . I was so young for BC that I feel like I need the extra insurance . I hopefully have a lot of years left . "

0,TRUE,marlegal and meece -- thanks for the info regarding how rads changes your breast . I have been concerned because this is my second lump on my left breast and it is smaller than the right . I am not very large to begin with . My first lump 13 years ago was for a B9 issue but the surgeon was able to do the incension around my nipple so it is not obvious at all . There was scar tissue in the 9 oclock position and my tumor was behind that next to my chest wall . So I have a nice 2 inch scar in the 9 o'clock position but that was the only way to get to it . The BS took a golf ball size tissue out to get clear margins . My headlight turns down and I have alot of dimple like look . Also my biopsy had to be an ultrasound guided biopsy and the needle thing was pretty large so I have two entry sites for that that look funny . With my bra and clothes on it is not noticeable at this time but I did talk to my RO about having an implant put in in the future if I am not happy down the road and he assured me that it would be an option . I just started rads so I will have to see how things go .

My surgery is scheduled for Dec. 9 , with immediate recon , but i 'm so back and forth about what recon to have - I have n't been able to tell my surgeon a def decision yet . I 've been reading all of your posts and you seem to be sure of your decisions but the more info i get the more confused i become . I 'm now leaning towards an implant , but a few people i 've talked to said why not get both sides done at the same time and be done with it . Now i 'm back to trying to make another decision and its so hard . If i just do the one , will i like how i look ?? how safe are they anyway ?? My plastic surgeon told me that they never have to come out later down the road unless i 'm not happy with them for some reason . Is that true , or as some of you have said they should come out in ten to fifteen yrs . ?? are they really a good option ? I do n't want to lose my muscles to a tram flap and the diep flap seem like such a long surgery and i would have to do it at a later date and at another location . also with those surgeries its a done deal , so you really have to be sure .

My remaining breast remains a very important erogenous zone for me and my partner and I would hate to achieve symmetry at the expense of sensation . This is all hypothetical but I just want to be well-informed before I make my final decision . Hope someone can shed some light on this .

0,TRUE,"Hi , I 'm new here . Reading everyone 's story is amazing ! I realize as I 'm starting this journey of lifelong treatment that there are so many incredible women out there who are so much farther down this wild road and doing well ... I think we need our own `` survivor '' show ! Here 's my story so far : Diagnosed in nov '09 with myelofibrosis , a serious bone marrow disease , frequent blood transfusions , low platelets . Had two abnormal colonoscopies in fall ' 09 , which led to a colon resection on 12/30/09 -LRB- yes , New Year 's Eve ! -RRB- to remove what my onc thought was early stage colon cancer , but ... Lab tests showed I had lobular breast cancer in my large intestine and my bone marrow , in addition to the myelofibrosis . So-in jan '10 I was diagnosed with stage iv BC , with no breast tumor . Treatment , started in feb ' 10 , is weekly low-dose taxol and monthly zolodex shots . I get regular shots of procrit -LRB- a red blood-cell growth factor -RRB- as needed . My platelets have multiplied during treatment and my transfusions have been cut in half , which is great . My blood levels are the only way to measure progress since I have no tumor markers . I had a recent PET scan -LRB- one week before my 50th bday -RRB- showing that all my cancer is inactive at the moment . So far so great ! Avastin is coming my way very soon . One other note : in addition to my unusual cancer presentation , I am Complications Woman . After my colon surgery I had to be rehospitalized for an intestinal obstruction . I have had three -LRB- count 'em -RRB- ports and a picc line so far . Port # 3 is working well , for three weeks now , fingers crossed . Thanks for reading my -LRB- too long -RRB- story .

0,TRUE,"I 'm six year out from chemotherapy , and on year 51/2 of hormone therapy -LRB- 41/2 of Arimidex -RRB- . I had onset of cognitive decline during chemotherapy , but it dramatically has worsened ever since . I did have neuropsychologic testing , as I also had a neuropathy and it was recommended . It showed immediate memory compromise -LRB- there is also short term , intermediate , and long term memory from what I understand -RRB- . I understood the Ph.D. tester to say that information may not be immediately remembered , yet down the road some , be remembered . Weird . The testing also showed word recall problems , math skill decline from expected education and I ca n't remember what else . The summary was I had executive functioning compromise , with memory impairment . We repeated the test one year later with some improvement noted in reading , vocabulary , but the immediate memory was still compromised as was reasoning , or logic . The tests were not specific for breast cancer patients , rather general population . I ca n't remember if I took one of my meds within a minute or so . This terrifies me . I stand in front of my medicine cabinet and literally ca n't remember if I swallowed my Arimidex . I tried techniques such as moving the bottle from a to be taken to a taken position in the bathroom , but then could n't remember if I had put it back to the to be taken from the taken position . So then I would think , well I ca n't take two pills , so I 'll wait 12 hours , and then take it . This I did , and I find that taking it at 6 p.m. and then again 6 a.m. , then getting back on track for 6 p.m. pretty much works . But now I use a 4 times a day pill dispenser as I have several meds . I find this to be humiliating . I know I should n't , but it 's just I never had these problems before . It scares me , makes me feel upset , and embarrassed . I kept closing the automatic car garage with the electronic device , and it kept going down and not closing . So I kept hitting the device , three , four times until finally I realized the car rear bumper was in the way of the door . Nice hole in the brand new cars paint . Every time I see it I get upset : I never use to be this way . I burned my hand pouring coffee , then moved the coffee cup and proceeded to pour the boiling water right on the burn site . Ended up with a second degree burn . Well , this is too much about me . But it 's my way of saying Saluki , that I truly believe the Arimidex , superimposed on the chemobrain , causes significant executive -LRB- reasoning -RRB- problems . A blankness of the mind . It 's scary and and I 'm sorry you and others are bothered by it too . Shirley , I wish to let you know , that my Dad has small vessel disease of the brain on MRI and he is basically fine . His neurologist said sometimes the scan is much worse than how the patient truly is . A mismatch . I hope your doctor might comfort you some in this regard , relax you some . If not , maybe review your MRI with a neuroradiologist . He or she may affirm they see a lot of brain changes with age , and the literature confirms all patients are different in what is clinically demonstrated . Then , just keep using your brain , on us ! Read , write , arithmetic . That 's how we help avoid the aging brain ! Thanks for starting this thread , Saluki . And Sierra , I hear you when you do n't `` recognize '' someone whom you know well .

2,TRUE,"valc : I know how you feel - I have only recently had a second reconstruction surgery to correct my non symetrical chest . . I had a bi-lateral and the ps screwed everything up !

This if f ___ king hard ! More difficult than it needs to be I think - if only when the doc 's first dx us we were assigned a psychologist along with our other consultants . . Our body image -LRB- and it does n't matter if you are not `` defined by your breasts '' or not ! -RRB- changes so drastically and I certainly saw myself as `` ruined '' . . Only recently , and again after the second surgery , do I feel that there is any hope of coming out of the funk that can go hand in hand with the dx . . It was n't my husband that cared what I looked like it was me and I spent a lifetime without makeup , never dieted , nursed my kids , excercised on a daily basis walking about 5-10 miles a day for my health ... Looks , I thought , did n't matter to me - but this surgery , mastectomy , does something to us that really is huge . . I have never had body image problems before and I believe we should all be allowed to feel the loss of our `` normal '' body ... There is of course a new normal , but it is , I 'm sure very much like any other human being who had had an amputation of any kind . There is a way back , and for me some of that is the corrective reconstruction -LRB- with implants -RRB- but for each of us it is different . . but I want you to know that no matter the level of cancer the blessing that early stage bc is you have the right and probably should expect to grieve ... I know I have been grieving and the more someone says it is a `` blessing '' that you `` only '' had DCIS the more depressed I seemed to become . This is an awful dx and I believe we have to expect to make room in our busy sometimes overwhelming lives to grieve the loss of a part of our body ...

0,TRUE,"Thanks Alymarie and Donalee for thinking of me . It was a very hard day . I feel like a rag doll that was tied on the back of a pick up truck and drug down a gravel road . Been on that wild roller coaster ride all day . First I woke up at 3:30 am anxious for the port surgery . Then they called me at 9:00 when I am all pumped up to go that they wanted to reschedule me . I whinned so much they decided to keep me on and bump someone else . I just could n't go through this night of no sleep again . Ok got there went up bravely to the check in desk and the nice lady behind the glass said , `` that will be $ 1,000.00 for your co-pay '' . I was so caught off guard that I just lost it and started to cry . -LRB- seems like I am so fragile these days and go to pieces at a drop of a hat -RRB- I do n't carry that kind of cash around ... all the other test the last two weeks has been $ 50.00 . I 'm thinking we pay $ 800.00 a month for insurance and then get hit out of the blue on this one . I read the insurance papers , but who can make out what is what ... I sure ca n't . I went to the member services and they looked it up on the computer and yep that was the co-pay ... many more tears cause I needed to get this done today . So the kind lady said ok we will bill you for it . I was a wreck by this point and I wo n't have to worry about leaking tear ducs cause they are going to be all dried up before I even start Chemo ! 2 hours later I got the port put in , but my body feels like I had worked a 48 hours shift ! I drug home and the oc called and the MRI did not exactly show the tumor , but she think she sees it behind these huge lymph nodes . She finally gave me a dx ... Locally Advanced Breast Cancer stage IIIA . At least 4 lymph nodes if not more involved . So ok gals help me figure this one out . Anyone in here with this dx or similar ? The reason they want to do chemo first aggressively is if they operated right now with the mass so large they may not get all the cancer , and they also want to get those cells that are out there in the body floating around . I ask her flat out if we are at the point of trying to control this tumor or get rid of the cancer and she said her goal was to get rid of it . "
0,TRUE,"just a thought here ... I had a decent sized lumpectomy , then 7 weeks of radiation which did shrink my breast somewhat . I had to wait a year before considering reconstruction . My plastic surgeon will not use an implant because of the radiation ... so I 'm looking at a free TRAM recon . I guess my thought here was that the radiation eliminated me from the implant option and faces me with a major surgery to reconstruct -LRB- for which I had to wait one year -RRB- and all along I was trying to avoid the major surgery by not having a mastectomy . It sounds like those of you that had mastectomies have had a long road with reconstruction . I guess there is no easy way out ! "

Also , a big help was talking to the plastic surgeon so i knew exactly what the process was for each option regarding reconstruction , since this was important to me . contact the breast cancer community to find doctors who have dealt with paget 's and also a plastic surgeon who has been reconized for their work in the masectomy community . it 's a tough road , esp since there are so few with paget 's , but you will get through it . i still have a long road in front of me with recovery and reconstrution , but it 's okay now that i am cancer free . good luck to you and stay in touch "

2,FALSE,"The way it was explained to me , PET scans pick up osteolytic lesions better and bone scans pick up osteoblastic lesions better .

0,TRUE,"My situation is not really the same as yours , but I chose no radiation . I had a diagnosis of DCIS -- on left breast in July '08 - this was after a digital mamm which showed a cluster of microcalcifications followed by a lumpectomy/surgical excision . So am about a year and a half out now . Mine was a very tiny , tiny area of DCIS -LRB- 1.6 mm -RRB- with nothing identified as comedo and no necrosis and I had clear margins after a surgical excision . I have not had any additional treatment besides my excisional biopsy last July which got all of the DCIS out . At follow up appt . a week after the biopsy , a medical oncologist spoke with me and told me that my tumor was sooo tiny he thought there was a miniscule chance it would cause me problems down the road and he did not recommend radiation therapy or hormonal therapy with their associated risks and side effects for my particular situation . He actually told me I was not to lose sleep over this or worry about it and he never expected to see me again . I also met with a radiation oncologist who wavered a bit on his recommendation , -LRB- seems I was sort of in a ` gray ' area on rad treatments mainly because of my age at time - 46 - and one margin although clear was ` close ' -RRB- but ultimately told me after we had a long discussion that he says I get a pass on this and that with my particular circumstances that if I were his wife , he would NOT treat me with radiation . Therefore , I decided against doing anything more except for close monitoring with mammograms and MRI 's as needed . Since that time I have had both follow up digital mamm on my left side in December '08 and a follow up MRI in Feb '09 as well as a regular annual bi-lateral digital mamm screening on both breasts in June '09 -- with nothing ` alarming ' showing up on any of these monitoring tests . I returned again a couple weeks ago for a re-check on the left breast due to some strange pain and sensations I was having , but after mammogram followed by ultrasound , the radiologist did not see anything of major concern . I am to have another breast MRI in February 2010 a year since last one and am fine with being monitored closely -LRB- just do n't find anything more thank you very much ! -RRB- I will have another yearly bi-lateral annual screening mamm on both breasts again next summer .

2,FALSE,"Liz , My husband loves my foobs because he loves me . Yes , they deform when I flex , which certainly happens during sex , but mostly we 've been in the dark or dim light , so I 've felt a little better about it , as they were n't as visible . I think regular silicone that is placed sub-pectorally will also deform during flexing too , because it is under the muscle , not necessarily because it 's a gummy . I wonder if someone who has had both can chime in on that ? I still occasionally wear a top too during sex . He would n't care if we were under fluorescent lights and he could see every ripple , dent , or oddity . He knows I 'm self conscious about them so does n't push me to disrobe when I do n't want to . I think he picks up on my vibe of `` this area is a no fly zone '' , and has respected that . I do n't have sensation back , and that does bother me , but I 'm told that may return in time . If it does n't , he 'll just continue to search for more `` responsive '' zones . I 've read every one of your posts from your first one over a year ago , because I too have really had a problem with the dents , bumps , bubbles , ridges , etc , of these door stops that now reside on my chest masquerading as boobs . I felt better reading your posts when you said that they loosed up and you were ok with the firmness now . I am also going to try fat grafting at some point in the near future . My PS wants me to wait because of the extra surgeries I needed for the infection I got . I feel for you going through this single , but please know that most guys will be too distracted with the fact that they are in bed with a beautiful , sexy and totally fabulous woman to notice what you see as glaringly obvious . Every time I call my husband in to the bathroom to look at a new `` deformity , '' that I 'd discovered , he actually has to really search for what I 'm seeing . Your new boyfriend will likely do that too . He will know about what you 've been through before you get to the point where you are in bed together , and will be sensitive to your feelings . My husband is just so happy that I 'm alive and doing well that I think he would n't care what I looked like . During that 5 week period after my infection when I only had one expander , he still wanted to be with me . To me I never looked worse , and thought my right side looked like an old lady without her teeth in . He did n't care . I , on the other hand , have n't been really that interested in sex for awhile since all this happened . BC can rip away at ones sexuality like nothing else . My husband looks at reconstructed , and un-reconstructed boobs for a living , and that may dull the impact of mine a little bit , but I think that regardless of the fact that he deals with cancer every day , he would still love my foobs for what they are , because of who they are attached to , not what they look like when flexing in a certain position . I will reiterate what many others have posted here , if he has a problem with the way you look or feel , then he is n't the man for you . There are so many men out there that will not just accept them , but LOVE them ! One thing I learned in my dating years ... Men do n't care how they look necessarily . It does n't matter what size , shape , or texture , if they are lucky enough to get some one on one time with them , they are happy as can be ! Now a question for you ... Has the fat grafting really helped with the dented appearance ? Are you still considering an exchange for traditional silicone ? Thank you for starting this thread Liz , it has been immensely helpful to me hearing about others experiences . I do n't feel so alone anymore . "

2,TRUE,"http://www.healthfreedom.info/Cancer%20Essiac.htm The Truth About Essiac Rene Caisse and her Herbal Cancer Treatment , ESSIAC Authentic , Original Essiac Tea Formula Documentation On a fateful day in 1922 Canadian nurse Rene Caisse happened to notice some scar tissue on the breast of an elderly English woman . The woman said that doctors had diagnosed her with breast cancer years before . However , the woman did n't want to risk surgery nor did she have the money for it . The English woman had met an old Indian medicine man in the 1890s who told her that he could cure her cancer with an herbal tea . The woman took the medicine man 's advice , and consequently she was still alive nearly thirty years later to pass on this herbal remedy to Nurse Caisse . About a year later , Rene Caisse was walking beside a retired doctor who pointed to a common weed and stated : `` Nurse Caisse , if people would use this weed there would be little cancer in the world . '' Rene later stated : `` He told me the name of the plant . It was one of the herbs my patient named as an ingredient of the Indian medicine man 's tea ! '' -LSB- I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse -RSB- The `` weed '' was sheep sorrel . In a 1974 letter to Dr. Chester Stock Rene Caisse stated : `` Who in the world would ever think to find a solution to cancer in a common meadow ? '' -LSB- THE ESSENCE OF ESSIAC , p. 127 -RSB- In 1924 she decided to test the tea on her aunt who had cancer of the stomach and was given about six months to live . Her aunt lived for another 21 years , cancer free . Rene Caisse -LRB- pronounced `` Reen Case '' -RRB- later gave the tea to her 72-year old mother who was diagnosed with inoperable cancer of the liver , with only days to live . Her mother recovered and lived without cancer for another 18 years . In the ensuing years Nurse Caisse refined and perfected the original `` medicine man 's '' formula . She tested various herbal combinations on laboratory mice and on human cancer patients . She eventually reduced the tea to four herbs : burdock root , sheep sorrel , slippery elm and turkey rhubarb . She called the formula Essiac , which is her surname spelled backwards . -LSB- Read `` I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse '' for more details . -RSB- Rene Caisse devoted over fifty years of her life to treating hundreds of cancer patients with Essiac . So effective were her treatments that in 1938 her supporters gathered 55,000 signatures for a petition , amongst other petitions , to allow Rene Caisse to continue treating cancer patients . A bill was introduced in the Ontario legislature to -LRB- allegedly -RRB- `` authorise Rene Caisse to practice medicine in the Province of Ontario in the treatment of cancer and conditions therein '' . Due to the machinations of the medical establishment , the bill failed to pass by just three votes . However , Rene Caisse made her views known regarding this bill which would set up the `` Royal Cancer Commission '' to investigate all possible cancer cures . She told the press : `` The people of Ontario will be paying a group of men to develop something that was developed and discovered 15 years ago . I have developed and proven a cure right here in Bracebridge , and I am running a clinic where hundreds of cancer sufferers are being treated and helped . Why then should I be asked to give my formula over to a group of doctors who never did anything to earn it ? '' -LSB- CALLING OF AN ANGEL , p. 59 . -RSB- WHAT DID DOCTORS SAY ABOUT RENE CAISSE 'S TEA ? Rene Caisse operated her cancer clinic under the supervision and observation of a number of doctors . Based on what those doctors saw with their own eyes , eight of them signed a petition to the Department of National Health and Welfare at Ottawa , asking that Nurse Caisse be given facilities to do independent research on her discovery . Their petition , dated at Toronto on October 27 , 1926 , read as follows : To Whom It May Concern : `` We the undersigned believe that the ` Treatment for Cancer ' given by Nurse R.M. Caisse can do no harm and that it relieves pain , will reduce the enlargement and will prolong life in hopeless cases . To the best of our knowledge , she has not been given a case to treat until everything in medical and surgical science has been tried without effect and even then she was able to show remarkable beneficial results on those cases at that late stage . `` We would be interested to see her given an opportunity to prove her work in a large way . To the best of our knowledge she has treated all cases free of any charge and has been carrying on this work over the period of the past two years . '' Initially , Rene was not aware of the control that the medical/pharmaceutical establishment had over governments . After the petition was delivered to the National Health and Welfare Department , she was continually threatened with arrest until she finally withdrew from public view . Unlike Nurse Caisse , the medical establishment was more interested in making money than in helping people . Essiac was cheap . It could cut into the lucrative profits from radiation , chemotherapy and surgery -- treatments that often do more harm than good . Essiac is non-toxic . Rene said , `` Chemotherapy should be a criminal offense . '' The story of Rene Caisse 's struggle to make Essiac an official cancer treatment was told by Dr. Gary Glum in his book CALLING OF AN ANGEL : ESSIAC , NATURE 'S CURE FOR CANCER . In a telephone conversation Dr. Glum stated that people who take Essiac on a regular , preventive basis do not get cancer . Dr. Glum interviewed JFK 's personal physician , Dr. Charles Brusch , who stated : `` I know Essiac has curing potential . It can lessen the condition of the individual , control it , and it can cure it . '' Dr. Ralph Moss was appointed to the Cancer Advisory Panel that evaluates alternative cancer therapies for the government . On his web site and in his book CANCER THERAPY , Dr. Moss points out that each of the herbs in Essiac has been scientifically shown to contain anticancer substances . In his `` Cancer Chronicles '' -LSB- www.ralphmoss.com/essiac] , Dr. Moss notes Essiac 's rising popularity by comparing Essiac 's low cost to a $ 150,000 bone marrow transplant . ESSIAC -- MORE THAN JUST A CANCER TREATMENT Dr. Frederick Banting , the co-discoverer of insulin became interested in Essiac and even offered Nurse Caisse research facilities to test it . According to Rene , Dr. Banting stated that `` Essiac must actuate the pancreatic gland into normal functioning '' . Even today diabetics are using Essiac to improve their condition and many have gone off insulin entirely . -LRB- For more information on diabetes and Essiac read the Dr. Marijah McCain interview . -RRB- Essiac has become widely known for its remarkable ability to boost the immune system and detoxify the body . Many people who drink Essiac tea regularly report feeling healthier with less incidence of colds and flu . Burdock , for example , has a well-established reputation for detoxification and support of the liver and organs of elimination . To read about additional benefits of Essiac , CLICK HERE to read the interview with Dr. Marijah McCain . BURDOCK ROOT -LRB- Arctium lappa -RRB- For centuries burdock root has been regarded as an effective blood purifier that neutralizes and eliminates poisons from the body . Burdock contains a volatile oil -- especially in the seeds -- that is eliminated through the sweat glands , taking toxins with it and alleviating skin problems . Burdock contains niacin , which is known to eliminate poisons from the body , including radiation . Burdock also supports the bladder , kidney and liver and has been said to dissolve kidney stones . It also contains an abundance of minerals , particularly iron . Studies have shown anti-tumor activity in burdock . Japanese scientists have isolated an anti-mutation property in burdock , which they call the `` B factor '' . The Japanese grow burdock root for food as well as medicine . A memorandum from the World Health Organization revealed that burdock was active against HIV . SHEEP SORREL -LRB- Rumex acetosella -RRB- Rene Caisse isolated sheep sorrel as the main Essiac herb that caused regression of metastasized cancer and reduction of tumors . She used the whole herb including sheep sorrel roots . Dr. Ralph Moss points out that sheep sorrel contains aloe emodin , a natural substance that shows significant anti-leukemic activity . Sheep sorrel contains antioxidants , is diuretic and has been used to check hemorrhages . Sheep sorrel is a traditional food of native cultures and is still served in fine restaurants along with other sorrels . CLICK HERE for more information about sheep sorrel . SLIPPERY ELM -LRB- Ulmus rubra/fulva -RRB- The inner bark of the slippery elm tree is well-known for its soothing and healing properties . It reduces inflammations such as sore throat , diarrhea and urinary problems . It has been regarded as both a food and medicine . Dr. Moss noted that `` slippery elm contains beta-sitosterol and a polysaccharide , both of which have shown -LSB- anti-cancer -RSB- activity . TURKEY RHUBARB ROOT -LRB- Rheum palmatum -RRB- Turkey Rhubarb has been shown to have anti-tumor activity . It is diuretic , anti-inflammatory , anti-bacterial and has been used extensively to relieve constipation . It is medicinally more potent than garden rhubarb root and is more palatable . CLICK HERE for more information about the rhubarb root in Essiac tea . CAVEAT EMPTOR * Due to the ever-increasing popularity of Essiac , numerous entrepreneurs have jumped on the Essiac bandwagon with their own four , six , or eight-herb products . Unfortunately , Rene Caisse was very secretive . She never published the formula and it appears that she experimented with different herbal combinations . Therefore , it is understandable that there would be controversies over who has the correct formula or the best product . Curiously , ESSIAC did n't become a trademark name until several years after Dr. Glum published the Essiac recipe . Yellow dock or garden sorrel is sometimes substituted for sheep sorrel . Imported turkey rhubarb may be irradiated , fumigated or both . So how do you know if you are buying the real , unaltered Essiac ? Many people become confused about Essiac tea after visiting various web sites with conflicting information . Unfortunately , Rene is not alive today to remind people that it 's all about `` helping suffering humanity '' , not money . As Rene stated in `` I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse '' , `` respect and love of our fellow man are more important than riches . '' Sheila Snow , author of THE ESSENCE OF ESSIAC and co-author of ESSIAC ESSENTIALS and ESSIAC , THE SECRETS OF RENE CAISSE 'S HERBAL PHARMACY , knew Rene Caisse personally and fortunately obtained a great deal of documentation to dispel much of the confusion about Essiac tea . Sheila Snow has passed on the Sheila Snow Fraser Essiac Archive Collection to Mali Klein , author of THE ESSIAC BOOK , 2006 . Essiac is truly a multi-cultural phenomenon . So here are the plain , non-commercial facts : 1 -RRB- Essiac marketers often claim that Essiac is an Ojibwa Indian formula . In `` I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse '' Rene Caisse referred only to `` a very old Indian medicine man '' without naming any specific tribe . Sheila Snow and Mali Klein have researched this issue extensively from the Essiac Archives and found that `` There is absolutely no evidence to support the popular assumption that he was a member of the Ojibwa tribe . There were six different tribes living in Northern Ontario at that time , including Algonquin -LSB- Anishinabeg -RSB- , Cree , Cherokee , Huron , Iroquois and Ojibwa as well as the refugees from other tribes in the United States , who were fleeing north of the border from the Indian wars . '' 2 -RRB- Turkey rhubarb -LRB- Rheum palmatum -RRB- is native to China and Tibet , not northern Ontario , so it appears unlikely that it was a part of the original medicine man 's formula of indigenous herbs in the late 1800s . Even today turkey rhubarb has still not established itself as a wild herb of North America -LSB- North America was originally called Turtle Island before the European Invasion and subsequent Holocaust -RSB- . `` The -LSB- Turkey -RSB- rhubarb rhizome official in the British Pharmacopoeia , 1914 , must be collected in China and Thibet . English-grown rhubarb is inferior to the official rhubarb in medicinal qualities . '' * Even the 1931 edition of A MODERN HERBAL reports that `` We still depend upon Northern China and Thibet for Rhubarb . '' * In Rene 's Caisse 's `` I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse '' she stated that the original formula came from an `` old Indian -LSB- who -RSB- showed her certain herbs growing ... in the the wilds of Northern Ontario . '' So far I have not seen any evidence that the Chinese herb Turkey rhubarb was growing in the wilds of Northern Ontario in the late 1800s . It is quite possible that Turkey rhubarb may have been an Asian-sourced modification made by Rene Caisse in her efforts to refine the formula . It has been suggested that Turkey rhubarb could have been purchased in Canada in the late 1800s but Rene Caisse specifically stated that the `` old medicine man 's '' herbs were growing `` in the wilds of Northern Ontario '' , not purchased . Rhubarb first appeared in North America in the late 1700s but only as a garden plant . Rhubarb does not have the invasive potential that burdock and sheep sorrel do as it needs to be planted and tended as a garden vegetable . Therefore , it is unlikely that it would have somehow naturally established itself `` in the wilds of Northern Ontario '' in the first 100 years of being introduced to North America . However , there is an edible plant that is mistakenly called `` wild rhubarb '' that is indigenous to Canada . When cooked , the juicy , bright red stems that appear soon after the snow melts resemble rhubarb . However , it is does not belong to the same genus as Rheum palmatum or Rheum officinale , but rather to the Polygonum genus . It is known by many names in many places as Knotweed , Bistort , American Bamboo -LRB- though not a bamboo either -RRB- , Heartweed , Smartweed , Snakeweed , Serpentgrass , Lady 's Thumb , Water Pepper and , of course , `` Wild Rhubarb '' . `` The delectable member of the family known as Polygonum bistorta thrives in the dry tundra of Alaska and northern Canada , even north of the limit of trees where Polygonum viviparum is also to be found . Extremely common in the Yukon and Northwest Territories , on the long McKenzie River and its tributaries as far north as the tree line , is the P. alpinum , which is more usually known there as Wild Rhubarb . '' -LSB- Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants by Bradford Angier -RSB- This is a plant that could have been part of the original `` old medicine man 's '' recipe for the English woman with breast cancer . It is then conceivable that either the English woman or Rene Caisse switched to the true rhubarbs from Asia as a substitute -- Or perhaps Rene Caisse did n't realize the difference between the native `` Wild Rhubarb '' and Asian/European rhubarb and she may have always used true rhubarb . After all , she was a mainstream medicine nurse , not an herbalist . The term `` wild rhubarb '' has even been applied to burdock and yellow dock , so pin-pointing the exact genus and species of this particular herb is difficult at best . There are many different plants that have similarities to rhubarb . Western Dock -LRB- Rumex occidentalis -RRB- , for example , is also called `` Indian rhubarb '' -LSB- TRADITIONAL PLANT FOODS OF CANADIAN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES , p. 225 -RSB- . Nurse Caisse also used `` Rheum officinale '' which is often called `` Indian rhubarb '' because it came from Asia by way of the trade route through India . Unfortunately , Rene was so secretive about the Essiac formula we will probably never know the whole story . CLICK HERE for more information about `` Turkey rhubarb '' and `` Indian rhubarb '' . Since the modern North American diet of over-processed foods can cause chronic constipation which can promote cancer , the addition of turkey rhubarb in the formula appears to have been a wise one . One of the first benefits that I noticed when I first began drinking Essiac tea was that my bowel movements normalized . After drinking Essiac tea for four years , I embarked on a thorough colon cleanse and discovered that my colon was already clean from daily use of Essiac tea . Several well-known American herbalists believe that 80 to 95 percent of all illnesses are due to unclean colons . Turkey rhubarb is now being grown commercially in North America , and that may very well be due to the ever-increasing popularity of Essiac tea . 3 -RRB- Burdock and sheep sorrel are not native to North America . It appears that both burdock and sheep sorrel were brought to this continent from Europe by early settlers who then passed on their knowledge of these two herbs to the local tribes . Burdock and sheep sorrel eventually spread throughout North America where water was sufficient . Unfortunately , they are often referred to as invasive `` weeds '' . Rene Caisse indicated that sheep sorrel was one of the original herbs , so it appears that sheep sorrel had migrated to `` the wilds of Northern Ontario '' before the 1890s . Burdock could have also established itself in Northern Ontario by then . 4 -RRB- Slippery elm is the only Essiac herb native to North America . In spite of the numerous , conflicting claims as to what the original Indian `` medicine '' man 's formula was , no one has yet offered any verifiable evidence to settle that issue . Some claim it was a four-herb formula while others claim it was an eight-herb , six or seven-herb formula . Many of these claims state that turkey rhubarb was one of the original herbs , which did not grow `` in the wilds of Northern Ontario '' . Rene Caisse did experiment with a number of herbs and changed the formula through time . It does appear that she gave different Essiac tea formulas to different people to try to find the best one . She also appeared to `` thrive on intrigue '' to throw people off the trail to guard her secrets . -LSB- See THE ESSIAC BOOK by Mali Klein -RSB- . Therefore , it is easy to see why so many people are marketing different versions of `` Essiac '' tea , all claiming to have the right one . However , she finally settled on her four-herb formula before she died . This four-herb formula was demonstrated by Rene Caisse and untold cancer patients to be an effective , health-giving remedy that has stood the test of time . However , Mali Klein , now the custodian of the Sheila Snow Fraser Essiac Archive Collection , reveals more untold stories , more Essiac mysteries , and sheds new light on the Essiac phenomenon in THE ESSIAC BOOK . The only person Rene Caisse trusted to help her make Essiac tea was her best friend , Mary McPherson . Mary had worked alongside Rene since the 1930s and knew the formula by heart . According to Dr. Gary Glum , Mary had promised Rene never to reveal the formula to anyone . The Essiac formula might never have made it into the public domain had it not been for Dr. Glum . He purchased the formula for $ 120,000 from one of Rene 's former patients . Dr. Glum could have kept the formula secret and become very wealthy selling bottles of Essiac . However , he unselfishly released the formula into the public domain in 1988 . At first he offered the formula on a video tape that he advertised in his book , CALLING OF AN ANGEL , but the feds unlawfully seized the tapes before he could sell very many of them . He then gave out the formula and recipe free of charge to anyone who mailed him a request for the Essiac formula . When Dr. Glum met Mary McPherson in Bracebridge , Ontario and told her what the Essiac formula was , she was more than a little surprised . According to Dr. Glum , Mary eventually revealed the formula in 1994 because it was no longer a secret , and she wanted to end the controversy over the Essiac formula before she died . Therefore , on December 23 , 1994 the `` Essiac '' formula & recipe was officially entered into the public domain with the recording of Mary McPherson 's affidavit . In `` I Was Canada 's Canada Nurse '' Rene Caisse stated one reason why she wanted to keep the formula secret : `` I wanted to establish my remedy , which I called ESSIAC or my name spelled backward , in actual practice and not in a laboratory only . I knew it had no bad side affects , so it could do no harm . I wanted to use it on patients in my own way . And when the time came , I wanted to share in the administration of my own discovery . '' Another reason why Rene kept the Essiac formula secret was that she did n't trust people to make it properly and she thought that it would be altered . For example , several years after Dr. Gary Glum published the four-herb Essiac formula and gave it away free of charge , Canadian talk show host Elaine Alexander marketed an eight-herb formula , which included the four herbs that Dr. Glum published . Her marketing campaign proclaimed that Essiac 's `` new name was `` FLOR ESSENCE '' -LSB- R -RSB- . She subsequently died of cancer . Even today a common misconception still exists that Elaine Alexander 's formula is Rene Caisse 's authentic Essiac formula . However , Mary McPherson 's recorded affidavit settled that controversy in 1994 . This eight-herb formula appears to be Dr. Charles Brusch 's own formula , not Rene Caisse 's Essiac formula . Furthermore , it appears that there were unethical activities made in the marketing of Elaine Alexander 's and Dr. Brusch 's formula . Claims were made that Dr. Charles Brusch knew the formula . However , researchers Sheila Snow and Mali Klein stated in their book THE SECRETS OF RENE CAISSE 'S HERBAL PHARMACY -LRB- p. 13 -RRB- : `` Considering Sheila 's 16 years ' association with Dr Brusch and his wife , and examining the evidence of the letters exchanged between them and with Mary McPherson , we must conclude that we do not believe that Rene ever gave Dr Brusch the Essiac formula . Therefore we must question any subsequent claims by people associated with Dr Brusch as having access to the original Essiac formula . '' Rene Caisse told Sheila Snow : `` I did n't give it -LSB- the Essiac formula -RSB- to Doctor Brusch and I 'm not giving it to anyone else . '' -LSB- THE ESSIAC BOOK , p. 74 -RSB- It also appears that Dr. Brusch 's name was forged on false documents . Dr. Brusch 's wife , Jane , stated : `` I am infuriated over all the different things I am hearing . I ca n't believe that so many people are using Charlie 's name and the things they are coming up with -- old signatures etc -- requests for peoples ' records and histories -- all lies . I turn all these over to our lawyer -- I am dumbfounded . '' CLICK HERE for more information about this situation . Every herbal formula has its own synergy and therefore creates a specific effect . Rene Caisse spent her life refining the formula with her hands-on research . No one else has done such extensive research on Essiac tea . The formula below was the final formula that she settled on after more than fifty years of experimentation and research with real cancer patients . Rene Caisse stated : `` If it works , do n't change it . '' -LSB- ESSIAC ESSENTIALS , p. 84 -RSB- THE FORMULA The following formula and recipe for Essiac -LRB- in italics -RRB- is a word-for-word transcription of the Essiac formula from the affidavit which Mary McPherson filed with the Town of Bracebridge . CLICK HERE to view a certified true copy of Mary McPherson 's two-page affidavit . The formula below is also the one which Dr. Gary Glum released to the public in 1988 when he published CALLING OF AN ANGEL : ESSIAC , NATURE 'S CURE FOR CANCER . Essiac 6 1/2 cups of burdock root -LRB- cut -RRB- -LRB- upper left -RRB- 1 pound of sheep sorrel herb powdered -LRB- upper right -RRB- 1/4 pound of slippery elm bark powdered -LRB- lower left -RRB- 1 ounce of Turkish rhubarb root powdered -LRB- lower right -RRB- Mix these ingredients thoroughly and store in glass jar in dark dry cupboard . Take a measuring cup , use 1 ounce of herb mixture to 32 ounces of water depending on the amount you want to make . I use 1 cup of mixture to 8 x 32 = 256 ounces of water . Boil hard for 10 minutes -LRB- covered -RRB- then turn off heat but leave sitting on warm plate over night -LRB- covered -RRB- . In the morning heat steaming hot and let settle a few minutes , then strain through fine strainer into hot sterilized bottles and sit to cool . Store in dark cool cupboard . Must be refrigerated when opened . When near the last when its thick pour in a large jar and sit in frig overnight then pour off all you -LSB- can -RSB- without sediment . This recipe must be followed exactly as written . I use a granite preserving kettle -LRB- 10 -- 12 qts -RRB- , 8 ounce measuring cup , small funnel and fine strainer to fill bottles . ADDITIONAL TIPS & INFORMATION The preparation of Essiac is as important as the formula itself . Essiac is a decoction , not an infusion . An infusion is what people make when they put a tea bag in a cup of hot water . Generally speaking , an infusion tends to extract vitamins and volatile oils . A decoction is used to extract minerals , bitter components , etc. from hard materials such as roots , bark or seeds by boiling for a few minutes and then allowing the herbs to steep for several hours . Entrepreneurs often sell Essiac imitations in tincture form -LRB- herbs in alcohol -RRB- or in gelatin capsules ; neither form is Essiac because Essiac is a tea and , more specifically , a decoction that must be made in a certain way in order to achieve the kind of results that Nurse Caisse was demonstrating . People often substitute stainless steel for an enameled pot and lid . The main concern is not to use an aluminum pot . Also , be sure not to use unfiltered , chlorinated water . The formula above can be reduced to 1/2 cup of herb mix to one gallon of water . -LSB- Optional : Dr. Glum suggests adding 2 or 3 cups of extra water to replace water lost through evaporation during boiling . Also , the dry herbs will absorb water as well . -RSB- After boiling for ten minutes , let the tea steep about 12 hours . Then heat up tea to steaming , but not boiling . -LRB- Do not boil twice . -RRB- The remaining pulp can be used for healing poultices . Do n't use cheese cloth to strain Essiac . Likewise , do not use a kitchen sieve that has a very fine mesh as this may filter out the slippery elm . Slippery elm gives the tea a slight viscous consistency when poured . If you do not notice this `` slippery '' consistency after refrigerating your tea , you may be using a sieve that is too fine . Do n't worry about herb particles in your Essiac ; they will settle to the bottom of the jars . Some people drink the Essiac dregs -LRB- particles that settle on the bottom -RRB- , others do n't . Some people give the Essiac dregs to their pets or farm animals as a health food . Many people have reported the same or similar health benefits with their pets that humans are reporting . The dregs can also be used topically as a poultice . It is best to refrigerate the Essiac tea as soon as it has cooled . Discard the tea if mold appears on the surface or if the tea does not taste right . CLICK HERE to learn about dosage . Make sure that the sheep sorrel you use is the small , wild variety of sheep sorrel and not a substitute like yellow dock or garden -LRB- French -RRB- sorrel . Imported turkey rhubarb root could be fumigated or irradiated . Many Essiac merchants are unaware of the quality of their herbs . The best way to insure that you 're getting true Essiac is to grow the herbs yourself . This puts you in control of product quality and takes out the commercialism . Burdock root is harvested in the fall of the first year . Slippery elm bark is wildcrafted or organically-grown and is easy to buy . Turkey Rhubarb is the only herb in Essiac that can not be wildcrafted in the US . The Chinese use six year old turkey rhubarb roots for maximum potency . EssiacUS.com usually has some Essiac herb seeds . * Quotes about Turkey rhubarb are from A MODERN HERBAL , first published by Jonathan Cape , 1931 The article above was written by Lanny Messinger , the original webmaster for this web site , who is now retired . `` We all have the right to benefit from Essiac because no one can stop us making it , no one can stop us taking it and no one can stop us deciding how and when we 're going to do it .

6,TRUE,"Good Morning Jewels , Again , I am amazed at all that 's been posted since yesterday ... KathyL and SheShe48-Shocking that a pediatrics office-an office that deals with medicine - can be so discompassionate to one of its own nurses . SheShe48-same to you ... a BC Survivor fired you ? I do n't think that 's even legal ... firing someone on the spot for disclosing they were diagnosed with cancer . -LRB- Not that I 'm advocating filing a wrongful termination suit - who would want to work for someone like that anyway -RRB- . I feel for you both on the tightening finances . I am sooooo lucky to work in my school district . We have a Catestrophic Leave bank that we donate to each year . I applied to be granted enough leave to get me through the end of the school year . I am awarded 20 days at a time , and have been told there is enough to get me to the end of the year plus plenty of days for others in our district who may need it . Once that is done , if I need more time , my disability insurance will kick in at 75 % of my pay . Kathy , I hear you about all the germs and being on your feet all day long . As a teacher , I 'm in the same boat . Parents send their sick ones to school all the time , and I often do n't get to sit all day long - except during my 36 minute lunch , if I take lunch as I often give up lunch to assist kids who need help - having 5 periods and over 130 + students in and out of the classroom . I had to take the rest of the year off ... and it killed me ... I miss my kids so much ... but I had to put my well-being first . D1-Not only is FUBC totally appropriate ... but FUSE -LRB- F. . U. . . Side . . Effects -RRB- too !!!! You crack me up ... even when you 're feeling like the Vikings snapped you the ball and let the other team trample all over you . I often say to the TV ... like it can hear me ... when pharmaceutical companies advertise their wares ... `` How can you put on that smile and do whatever it is you 're doing with all those SE 's ? '' Notice the SE 's are stated quickly in the background like we wo n't notice . Who can function at all , let alone have sex , with a four hour erection , loss of hearing , and eyesight ? And those SE 's for the CMF chemotini sound dreadful ... of course , not everyone experiences these SE 's ... and they have to be disclosed ... but that 's scary shit ... oops , sorry ... it just slipped out ... must be an SE of BC . Vettegal-I hear you on being impatient ... and agree with all the advice/support already given . I had nodes removed on the left side at the same time as my bilat , and healing is slow , but it does get better little by little and day by day . Hang in there ... oh , you ca n't do that yet -LRB- neither can I now that I mentioned it -RRB- ... ummm ... Stiff upper lip dahling ... you 've got the right stuff !!! Love the T-Shirt idea . My DH was in landscaping for over 15 years before he blew his back out . After three surgeries ending in fusion , he had to give it up . He 's now an energy analyst at a consulting firm working to get alternative energy plants built-solar , wind , biofuel , geothermal , and hydrogen . Carol - A Tugboater and a Truckdriver ? That 's great !!!! My father is working with a group to restore an old WWII tugboat from Pearl Harbor . He was in Hawaii when it was bombed-he was 5 - and his father was a civil engineer hired by the govt to do things like work on the Panama Canal and stuff . Anyway , my dad feels his father may have been on this tug as he toured the damage and worked on a plan to clear away all the wreckage and repair docks and the like . My mother , who passed away at 58 of Pancreatic Cancer , was a wonderfully funny lady . She often stated that when she retired she wanted to be a poet truckdriver . Hee Hee . Sorry to hear your mom passed of melonoma . Anyway , I 'm with you on making 2008 the year I show the world what this gal is made of ... let 's kick butt this year !!!!! Sharon-Thanks for the info on Neupogen and Nuelasta . I know I 'm supposed to get a shot of something the next day after chemo ... but ca n't recall the name of it . Still have n't heard from my oncologists office ... I 'm thinking they took today off and will do the same tomorrow . Welcome Julie K and Chris . You 've found a great group here . Julie , I am 99 % positive that I 'll be getting a hysterectomy and have my ovaries removed , which is apparently not included in a hysterectomy -LRB- uterus only , I believe -RRB- in order to reduce my likelihood of ovarian cancer . My dad had breast cancer and prostate cancer -LRB- still living -RRB- , and my mother pancreatic cancer -LRB- passed at 58 -RRB- , and all of those cancers are tied to the BRCA2 gene ... so Dad 's taken the BRCA test as of last week-my insurance wo n't cover it because we do n't have enough cancer in the family line ... go figure - If he 's positive , then insurance has to cover my test ... but more importantly , my twin will have no problems getting her test approved . I already did a bilateral mastectomy-which is one choice my oncologist would have strongly suggested had the test results been in hand prior to surgery ... and I 'm glad I did have a bilat ... the right breast did have precancerous cells roaming around . Now , the test will determine if I have all my female plumbing removed , since my cancer is ERPR + . Sounds like your family history is full of this dreaded disease , too . I 'm sorry your family has had to go down this road . Has your sister regretted her decision to remove her breasts and female plumbing ? My twin is a bit unnerved by this whole thing ... to be expected . I think I 've gotten everyone ... if not ... know I 'm thinking about you and wishing you nothing but dreamfilled nights , energy filled days , and clear headed minds :--RRB- By the way , Charlie Wilson 's War , was FABULOUS !!!! It 's amazing what this man did ... and how we find ourselves in the same position again ... doing the same thing we 've always done only this time without a man like Charlie on the team . When will our gov ' t learn from its mistakes ? I read the Kite Runner , YuYuBear , and hear the movie is really good ... but I loved the book so much and do n't want to spoil what I imagined in my head ... and heard the movie gives too much away too soon . I 'll have to wait and see if I can bring myself to go see it . I 'm a little weird when it comes to my characters in what I read ... I literally have to grieve the end of a book ... I ca n't pick up another for a day or two ... OK , that 's a lot weird . Happy New Year Jewels ... tonight at the stroke of midnight , I 'll be toasting us all !!!! Love , your SIS -LRB- Sister In Survival -RRB- Kimberly "
2,TRUE,"Hello ladies ! I got a fill yesterday of 120cc 's so now I am 380 out of 500 . My fills will be done on Sept 23rd -LRB- 2 more to go -RRB- and then he said exchange to gummies will be in December , the week before Christmas . That will be 3 months from the final fill . He mentioned that he usually has the patient back one month before the surgery where he does one more fill if required . I am so excited . My original mastectomy was Nov 2008 so this is 2 years in the making . I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel ! "
4,TRUE,"P.S. Holly , is n't it funny that , probably because we kept half our hair , most people think we look `` soo goood '' after doing chemo ? I get that too and on one hand , it is great and am thankful for keeping some hair , on the other hand it is a little weird because people just do n't realize that we have been through the ringer . Loosing all of your hair would be really tough , but people do n't expect you to be normal energy ... expectations are higher ... ? Just some musings . I hope you are taking time to rest . Please do n't feel you have to just share good stuff here Holly . We are here for support -- this ai n't an easy ride ! "
2,TRUE,"I agree - best to let them know so we can help spare the next person -LRB- and us ! -RRB- . They need to understand how their words can rock our worlds , and we need all the hope we can get in our pockets . I saw a neurosurgeon a few weeks ago , who apparently thought I was too chipper in light of my brain mets . He leaned over and told me , you DO realize this is pallative care and there is no cure , right ? Well , duh mister ! I was doing just fine in my world of positive thoughts until you said that . I am writing him so he understands his words shook my life raft of hope and almost dumped me into the dark ocean . We just want them to help us fight - they can keep their old and crappy statistics to themselves : > Good luck !! lisa "
5,TRUE,"OK , I 'm joining you all on the Tamoxifen train . Had 3 lumpectomies and radiation last year and refused the Tamoxifen cause I coul n't stand the thought of feeling WORSE AFTER MY RADIATION WAS OVER . So this year my sister 10 years younger -LRB- 47 , I 'm 57 -RRB- gets diagnosed withe Stage 3 Lobular carcinoma is on chemo and will be on radiation also . So besides being a super bummer for her , my risk goes up and I 've agreed to Tamoxifen . Just waiting for my first prescription . So here I am and will keep in touch ! "
2,FALSE,"Hi everyone-was reading some posts last night around midnight . There have been a few people that are on the same regimen as I am that have posted day 14 is the day their hair started coming out . I pulled on my hair , sure enough-big clump . Had me feeling weird-not upset really , I knew it was inevitable and my hair is short anyway , so I do n't think it 's going to bother me to be bald -LRB- who knows though huh ?! -RRB- . I guess it is the fact that it makes this whole thing REAL . I have had minor SE from the chemo and neulasta and have felt pretty good over the last 4 days-easy to kind of go into denial , especially now that I feel healed from my surgery . Started cleaning like a madwoman -LRB- control , you know -RRB- ! Remember that `` mental clarity '' I mentioned earlier ... clear mind went out the window once the hair started coming out-the hairs must be little pieces of brain on them because I was in a fog all day , -LRB- and this was before dose number 2 today at noon today . -RRB- It was my firstborn 's twelfth birthday today and we had arranged a play date with someone that she likes very much and has never had the chance to get together with outside of school . Picked up the kids and friend after chemo and was driving down the road . Heard fire truck sirens and could see the truck coming toward us to the light I had stopped at . Once my light turned arrow green , I proceeded to pull out into the intersection before the truck passed-DUH ... Was n't a close call for accident or anything just totally improper etiquette . I told the kids that Mom is `` stupid '' today and they laughed . OK-so here 's something funny . I hope this is n't TMI but I have a few small hemorrhoids which have been bothering me because of loose stools -LRB- thank goodness not constipation ! -RRB- Anyway , I used some preparation H this morning . . After I at the cancer pavilion for a while-getting labs , seeing the onc . I used the restroom . I looked down at the inside of my khaki pants and there 's a line of `` grease '' from the prep H . A big one , mind you that goes up the back end and is entirely visible to anyone looking at me walk away . OMG-hilarious . I borrowed some scrubs for the rest of the visit . My family is going to crack up at this one !!! OK-this foggy girl is going to be getting ' to bed early tonight . Take care all . Laurie "
0,FALSE,"Hi everyone from the Arctic Circle !!! -- It sounds like everyone survived Christmas and it 's on to New Year 's Eve tomorrow . So the last time I checked in was the 22nd . Here 's why ------ That night the water went off in our house . I walked back behind the shelterbelt -LRB- trees around our house -RRB- and tried to get the lid off the well house pit so I could climb in there and see what was going on . AS IF I would even know , but I did take a little meter with me to check the power , but it was all for naught because I could n't get the lid off . So I called the guy that works on the wells and he said he could come out the 23rd and see what was up . We have bottled water so drinking was no problem and I can walk out to the outhouse just like the old days . But my Mom had to use the inside toilet so I got a milk bucket and hauled water from the rain tanks outside -LRB- the part of them that was thawed out -RRB- and kept filling the back of the toilet for her . So he came out on the 23rd and got it to trickle into the house , but not enuf pressure to fill the toilet , washer , or take a shower . We had enough that I could boil water and use that to wash dishes and fill the back of the toilet with pans if you waited a long time . It was doable . I had a friend from Michigan who teaches in Jordan come down for Christmas . She helped me haul water for Mom . Also on the 23rd one of my good friends passed away of an inoperable brain tumor . She had been sick for 8 months . It was not a shock , but very sad right before Christmas . She had 2 young children . At the ranch , we had a pretty good Christmas with the water issues aside , but my mom started not feeling all that well . She has blood pressure and heart issues and is suffering from a bit of dementia . So on Monday the 26th the well guys came with a big crane thingy and pulled my well and put in a new pump and it started working just fine . We all cleaned up our acts and I called the hospital and took my mom to town . Once they got a hold of her -- they kept her . She 's having tests run and has had lots of water removed from her feet and legs . She has had heart problems for years , but it 's been very hard to get her to go see a doctor . She 's pretty stubborn . Anyway , I may be able to bring her back home this afternoon . It 's been snowing and blowing for the past two days and is right now a blizzard . I just heard on the radio that they 're thinking of closing the highway due to visibility . When I came home from the hospital last night , my renter and a guy from the road department stopped me on the highway and told me that I could n't go back to my ranch because the crossing over the dam on my ranch road had collapsed . I told them that I could drive down into the creek and go across the lower crossing . They did n't believe me and actually followed me to the top of the hill that goes down to the crossings to see if I made it . They actually put `` road closed '' signs on my road . They are supposed to come out today with some equipment and rebuild my crossing over the dam , but I do n't know if they 'll come and do it with all this snow coming down . I probably wo n't be able to rescue my mom for a little bit . Ah , the joys of daughterhood . Mary , I love exercise -- I could sit and watch other people do it for hours !! In fact I do -- The Amazing Race is one of my favorite shows . Those people run all over the place . Janie , someday all my stacked up boxes are gon na fall over on me and that 's how I 'll probably go . Either that or one of my numerous bookshelves . On the Herceptin front , I looked back over my journals and I was remarking on nausea and diarrhea from the very first treatment , but they all said it was just left over from the Taxol . They kept blaming the Taxol for my rashes and all my digestive problems too . Four months into the Herceptin I was writing in my journals that I was getting pretty sure it was the Herceptin . I had my gall bladder removed in Feb and they thought that maybe that had been causing all my problems . Well , by April I was still having problems and the doctor in Baker actually told me that he thought it was cumulative effects of the Herceptin . My oncologist laughed . HMMM . Then in May I was hospitalized in Glendive for 2 days , June 3 days , July 4 days and August 13 days . In August my PCP jumped on the bandwagon with me after 6 million tests and decided that it had to be the Herceptin . And my oncologist after that marathon reluctantly agreed that H seemed to be causing me H in the gastointestonal department . YA THINK ???? So they did cut down the dose because they finally noticed that I did n't weigh 180 pounds anymore and had n't for a long time . They actually started weighing me each time near the end . BUT bottom line is that I did the whole year and a half of chemo and am still here to talk about it . I 'm ER/PR -- and HER2 + + + + also so we shall work through this together as the little guinea pigs that we are -- HUH ? I also would like to Thank You all for being here for me . I know I tend to ramble . This got longer than I plannned . Well , I 'm all alone in the house except for Mom 's psycho cat and my looney border collie and they both are wandering up here staring at me so I think I 'd better see what 's up . Happy 2006 everyone . On my part I think it could be a little less eventful and I 'd be happy . Life is Good -- Smiles -- NancyLee "
0,TRUE,Mastectomy is such a drastic choice ... if it were me I would try tamoxifen and be monitored - if things progress then you still have the option of mastectomy down the road ... . or maybe you wo n't have to do that at all . Tami
0,TRUE,"I am 47 and just had bilateral mast with immediate saline implants on May 7th . I know I can get nipples later on down the road as well as tattooes . DH says he does n't care if I do , he said from the beginning it was OK if I did n't get implants but I did it for me . I had so many complications post-surgery that I really do n't want to do any more than necessary to get them looking even and more like breasts than blobs . "
5,TRUE,"This site is amazing . I thought I was finished with everything , the surgeries , the chemo , even adjusting to the tamoxifen . And then 1 year to the date the Anxiety hits me like a train wreck . People say I look and act calm and in all actuality I am ready to jump out of my skin . Dealing with `` normal stuff '' kids in college , mother having health issues , AND check ups for BC just seemed too much . I went to my regular doc who immediately put me on Celexa - which started a whole lot more questioning - why ca n't I deal with this w/out meds ?? Whats wrong with me ? Your quote is perfect . My DH is urging me to make sure this is a short term solution , but like you all are saying , it will have to work on my own schedule . I think the thing that pushed me over the edge was losing my 16yr old Jack Russell Terrier last month . He was my stress reliever and I miss him so much . DH does n't want another dog , so I guess he will have to deal with a wife on antidepressants ! "
2,TRUE,"rachel - Thanks for the support and the caring . I can tell what a caring person you are - it shows . I bet your a great teacher , your students are lucky to have you . Hope your bloating goes away soon . When do you start Rads or have you started ? Its so hard to keep up and I got behind the 5 day hospital stay . Others who have had their taxotere reduced have made out well so I 'm going in optimistic - or trying to . I only have one more tx after Friday so I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now . Hangin in . Thanks again , you ladies are truly a great support system . "
2,TRUE,"LuAnn makes a great point to encourage your posts on the lobular thread . Many sisters post actively and there is an expert named Matix who regularly addresses questions . To address your question of what guides the ER + / Pr + or ER + / PR - states , it is the ER + -LRB- positivity -RRB- w.r.t. receiving a hormonal . So your treatment would have been the same . A caveat to this is the ER + / HER + state , which you were negative for . HER2 , also known as ERBB2 , amplification is associated with tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer . A 5 % ER + / PR - current hormone report on your just removed nodule , is beyond my insight to advise you one way or the other , Jean . A vigorous discussion of the merits of staying on Falsodex in light of your bone metastasis which appear stable , should be had with your oncologist , as ER + cancer frequently metastasizes to bone . As it can be somewhat difficult to treat bone mets , your current status is good , and one hates to change a horse mid-stream if it 's winning a race . On the other hand , your status has indeed changed to lower overall estrogen sensitivity . You need to discuss all this with your oncologist . A lymph node is a small bean like structure , designed to harbor our bodies immune cells . Sometimes one may find it loosely referred to as a `` node '' . So I always ask , is what was removed a `` node '' as in a `` lymph node '' or a `` nodule '' which is the term frequently used to reference a mass or nodule -LRB- collection -RRB- of tissue . Enough now . Time for both of us to wrap some presents , and smell the cloves and cinnamon . I might try to make an old fashioned Pecan Rum Cake for a gathering ... it 's been years since I made it .

2,TRUE,"Hi , Vicki ... As you know , I had a bilateral IGAP this past June . When I had my bilateral mastectomies in 04 , I tried expanders but had issues with them after radiation and one failed -LRB- left a stupid HOLE in my chest ! -RRB- . I am tall -LRB- 6 ' 2 '' -RRB- with an athletic build , so I did n't have much spare belly fat for a DIEP and with the athletics , I did n't want to have muscle moved or manipulated -LRB- so TRAM and Lat flaps were out -RRB- . As the top of my rear end also did n't have enough fat to harvest two breasts -LRB- doc said it was `` too muscular '' - who knew ?!? -RRB- , my only option was an IGAP . Although It is a big surgery - in that it is a long time to be under anesthesia -LRB- mine took 11 hours -RRB- and the recovery -LRB- as in being able to do all the things you were able to do before surgery , which for me , that meant karate , running and lifting weights -RRB- is longer than with implants - I 'd do it again in a heartbeat . The pain was n't bad at all and the `` I ca n't reach down to tie my shoes ! '' phase did n't last long . I was able to walk on a treadmill two and a half weeks out , was back to karate by week five and back to my full lifting schedule by week six . I am sooooo happy with the results -LRB- just had stage 2 about three weeks ago -RRB- ! My new girls move and feel like breasts - both in an athletic bra and out of one . If this is what you really want , I think you should go for it . I hope your doc sees the light and encourages you to do the same ! All the best to you ... "
2,TRUE,"@ Shellie - vent all you want sweetie . I cried for the first few weeks , I think everyone should at some point . Nobody wants this . It was n't what we signed up for . And the chemo sucks ! I found out a long time ago I was n't in charge anymore and had to start letting others do for me . So now I have to let the chemo do for me . All I can do is manage the SE 's the best I can , and hope and pray that tomorrow they are better . Tho they say 7-10 days of crappy is what ya can expect . So I can expect around 4 days of feeling better before I have to start over again . One of my gf 's in Mich is doing the regimen I am on with the AC for 8 weeks and the Tax for 12 and she said the tax is much better . A small light at the end of the tunnel ! "

I have already shopped and bought a wig , a turban , a hat , and two soft sleeping turbans . I am planning on having my head shaved before I start chemo .

5,TRUE,"So when SS tells breast cancer patients , or any cancer for that matter , that `` chemo will kill you '' , is that not `` black or white '' .

For many women , including you nixieschaos , it was a valuable resource in your arsenal . No , not the only resource , and I think it is great that supplements helped you as well ; however , you can not deny that if you took Ms. Somers advice and went with the `` chemo is killer poison '' train of thought , chances are you would not be here today to talk about it .

I am also working out 2-3 week on the Firm 's `` Wave '' and trying to get in walking -LRB- even if it is just with the doggies -RRB- or a bike ride the other nights . Am slowly amping it up as I feel better - was slowed down by 2 weeks of Femara se 's , but as I 'm not taking that now , and am waiting to see what the next trial will be , I intend to just keep moving and eating better . My weight prior to dx was 169 , which I feel is still too heavy for me , I am 5 ' 6 '' , and really want to be around 145 , but after chemo & rads , it was 179 .

I am working a full day and then driving an hour to treatment . My husband has been going with me and he likes to eat out after treatment . We did n't get home last night until 8 . I went today by myself so got home a little earlier . i am `` normal '' tired right now but otherwise feeling pretty good . These expanders are driving me crazy but I can stand it . They wo n't do my exchange surgery as soon as I hoped because they want my skin to have time to heal after radiation . The incisions have healed really well . I know you have a tough road ahead with the chemo but take care of yourself and do n't worry about the classroom . Taking care of this is the most important job of all . And besides , with all the sickness going around you ca n't afford to be in the germ factory especially KG . We have had some kind of flu and upper resp . infection going around but no cases of H1N1 yet . I just keep hand sanitizer at my desk . I hope your fills are easy and things stay on track for you .

0,TRUE,"Hi there . I was a stage IIIa , diagnosed three years ago . At the time I only had the cancerous breast removed -LRB- then chemo and radiation -RRB- . On Monday I will be having a prophylactic mastectomy on the other side . My surgeon told me that lobular can `` jump '' to the other side so I 'm just going to have it removed . Other than the surgery on Monday I am doing fine . I am training to do the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in NYC in October . I did it the year after my treatment and believe it helped motivate me to exercise which I believe was very beneficial for me . Good Luck with your treatments . I thought the chemo was the harder part so you have the toughest road behind you . Jeannette "
0,TRUE,"Maybe these are dumb questions , but I 'm curious about how many of you have implants that actually feel soft and pliable ? Did they feel that way from the beginning or did it take some time ? I 'm 6 months down the road from my 2nd implant surgery and only remember softness for a couple of weeks after this one was placed -LRB- the first one was firm from the beginning -RRB- . Also , how long did it take for your scar to fade ? Mine is still very prominent after 6 months and the thought of having it opened again to remove another failed implant is n't very pleasant . I know that my body makes way too much scar tissue and this implant will never soften up , but I am really curious about how many of you are lucky enough to be happy with your reconstruction results . -- bonnie "

0,TRUE,"I was kind of happy and kind of sad about it . He agrees that the strength of taxatere and carbo are to strong for me . My platlet counts are down . OK so 3 weeks ago I had tx and the following week I had blood work and they said my platlets were 26 thousand and the following week they went up to 34 thousand and this week they dropped back down to 26 thousand so how did they do that ? My wbc and rbc are down to . My bone scan is about the same he said so all this and I have nothing positive out of it exept that my TM 's went down 10points , If my platlets went down in 3 weeks how does one expect them to jump up over a 100 thousand in 1 week . He has me scheduled for chemo next wed. . I really do not think that is going to happen . I layed awake last night thinking that all those little cancer cells are having a party knowing that they did not get blasted with chemo yesterday . Has anyone had low platlets and how long did it take for them to come up over 100 . He said it would be useless to do a platlet transfusion because it only lasts 2 days and he can not do transfusion every 2 days unless it is an emergency . I am so mad that there is no change in my bone scan . He is going to lower the dose when I do have chemo again . If a high dose did not do anything than how is a lower dose going to work . I think that I am looking at a long road of chemo and no breaks . I was hoping to get lucky and just do the 6 months on and be done with it but unless a miracle happens I will not have hair for a while . I am so disapointed . hugs "
6,TRUE,"Hey kids - I had a kinda yucky day . My stomach has been cramping like I 've eaten something too spicy . I have been in bed or on the couch all day . I also went to gloomy-town today . I ca n't remember who posted about depression but I 've been like a cry baby all day . This is definitely not like me but it is notable . If my stomach does n't get better by tomorrow I am going to call the doc . I am suppossed to see the chiropractor/acupunturist tomorrow - -LRB- he does both - how convenient -RRB- . Maybe he can get me happy again too ! I have purposely not told anyone the life span averages since I 've gone into mets . I have an 18 year old that is going to college this year and my baby is 13 - both girls . I am a single mom so I need to stay here at least 6 more years to get her graduated . That is twice the average my doc at MD Anderson gave me . I believe that God can completely heal me and that is what I am speaking and partly why I did n't tell even my closest friends - just because I did n't want the negative talk . I do n't know if that makes any sense . But I am tired having this . -LRB- Yeah , I know - who is n't ? -RRB- But it is good to talk to people in the same boat . I just looked up this place in Baja , California that does the whole alternative medicine deal . They claim to be able to cure cancer patients but it is a base of $ 28000 and they tell you to bring $ 5000 - $ 20000 more for other treatments you might incur . As a teacher , I do n't have that kind of cash laying around . But it does make me want to try it . But then again I need to do what Barb said and start juicing . For crying out loud I have a juicer , one of those Jack Lalaine deals . I have barely used it . Hook me up with the easy to swallow recipes , Barb . Maybe I will fell like I 'm in Baja after a few drinks . Sorry to be a downer to night . I am going to go to happy-town tomorrow . Thanks for being here . "
6,TRUE,"I had the almost same thing happen to me . I was not feeling good about my oncologist . I decided I needed to trust the person who was planning my chemotherapy as much if not more than my husband . I talked to my husband and daughter -LRB- grown -RRB- we all felt that we needed to find an oncologist that is going to respond to phone calls for help . Nothing like being in the ocean with no boat . Maybe you can ask to talk to your oncologist , then you could let him know you need to be able to trust that he or someone appointed by him be there if you need them . That is imperative for all of us .

0,TRUE,Hi Debbie - I 've been on Navelbine for four weeks now . I get Navelbine once a week on Tuesdays with no breaks . Tomorrow will be my fifth time . I 've been very fortunate because it is the easiest chemo I have done . The whole chemo event takes about an hour . I have one nausea premed -LRB- I ca n't remember which one -RRB- then I get my Navelbine -LRB- takes 10 minutes -RRB- and then I get a bag of fluids for the road . In and out in one hour . I 've had no hair loss or thinning . I 'm completely functional the next day . I have n't experienced much fatigue . I will say that 2 out of the 4 treatments they had to reduce the dosage because my nutrifil -LRB- ANC -RRB- counts were low . I started my Neupogen injections -LRB- I self inject -RRB- and was fine for my last chemo . We 'll see how tomorrow goes . It sounds like you 've been doing this for awhile and I have been too . I 'm hoping the Navelbine works . The doctor is holding off on a CT scan until sometime around mid-July or August . I am for the first time becoming aware of wheezing so I do n't know what that means . I wish you the best of luck and hope that you do n't experience side effects . Take care . Kim
0,FALSE,"I had my port put on on Feb 25 , A week later we went on a vacation before the start of my chemo on March 24 . No one gave me any idea at all how much the port would hurt and riding in a car 8 hours to get where we were going was miserable . The bouncing over bumps etc in the road made the port bounce too , I was sore there for 2 days after each car ride and had to sleep with head elevated . And of course since we drove to get there we had to drive back too ! Since I will be having taxol for 12 weekly doses and then herceptin every 3 weeks for the balance of a year a port was the only option . The worst of the pain was gone at about 3 weeks but I still have to watch how I lay down at night . We will see how it goes with my first round on Tuesday . Annette "
0,TRUE,"Hi , I was diagnosed one month before turning 47 . The ultrasound showed it was small -LRB- 8 mm -RRB- and so I thought this was not going to be a big deal , lumpectomy and rads . I met with my BS on Nov 5 , 2009 and I immediately knew he did n't think it was no big deal . He explained that it was Grade 3 and TN . When I met with my onc , she said that it had one of the highest mitotic -LRB- cell division -RRB- rates she had seen . My BS suggested I do the genetic test because of the TN , my age , and the fact that my paternal grandmother died from BC in her early 50s . I was fortunate to be able to do the test right then and found out my results a week later , BRCA1 + . We have now found that my sister is positive as well . She is 40 and just had her first mammo , everythings OK . Anyway , I chose Bi-lat because of the BRCA1 + , I did n't want to go down this road again . I had my bi-lat 2 days before my 47th birthday . My BS said I would never forget this birthday as it was the one in which I got rid of my cancer . I did 4 bi-weekly DD A/C treatments follow by 4 DD Taxol . I had my last Taxol on April 21 , 2010 . I am now on hair watch . I am scheduled to have my port removed in two weeks -LRB- yeah -RRB- . On June 4th , I am going to have a hysterectomy and then I going to enjoy the summer without treatments , surgeries , etc. . .

4,TRUE,"Femme - one more thought - although implants may be a `` faster '' route to breast recon than flaps , they often cause infections and scar tissue build-up which then needs more surgery -LRB- as you 've already been through -RRB- . Flap procedures may take longer at the start , but once you 're done , you 're done for good . My own free-tram experience was not typical -LRB- quite a roller-coaster ride -RRB- but yesterday I just had the final `` tweaking '' done on my fipple -LRB- very minor out-patient surgery with Dr Israeli -RRB- ... ... now I only need a bit of tattooing for the color . The breast is now soft , and fills out my bra - it 's very symmetrical and I can sleep on my stomach . THe initial investment of time was much more than for an implant - but ultimately - from here on in - I wo n't need to worry about problems in my reconstructed breast . Also - if you do n't have enough abdominal fat for a Diep , Dr. Israeli also performs a flap from the thigh -LRB- I forget the name -RRB- ... ... . in any event , it 's a tough decision you have to make . At one point I thought about having both breasts removed and going flat - there was a photo of woman who did this and she had a beautiful vine-tattoo running across her chest . No lumps or dimples or skin tags - her PS made her chest as smooth as a 10-year olds ... ... so that 's something else you can think about too . Good luck and I 'll be praying you get the answers you need ! "

I am 48 , married , no kids , no family history and some days I 'm still shaking my head over my diagnosis and wondering how I got here . I 'm healthy , I exercise regulary , I do n't drink and I stopped smoking 10 yrs ago . I had lumpectomy and SNB 1/4/10 . All 3 sentinel nodes removed had cancer .

0,TRUE,"Nala : I was diagnosed with LCIS in January after a biopsy for calcifications -LRB- I had previously had biopsies for calcifications and removed a fibroadnoma -- two years ago when I knew something was wrong since having a problem in both breasts , what were the odds that something was n't wrong ?? -RRB- . Anyway two years ago , everything was benign , but this time they found LCIS . I was told by my breast surgeon that they would need to do another biopsy to reconfirm the diagnosis -LRB- which was fine with me -RRB- and to make sure that 's all that was there . Before surgery I had to have the MRI which showed another fibroadnoma this time close to the site where the LCIS was found , so I asked the surgeon to take that out while in there . I was also referred to a breast wellness center at Duke University and told my options : careful monitoring -LRB- testing every 6 months with mammos and MRIs and breast exams -RRB- , clinical trials -LRB- things like random biopsies -RRB- , or masectomies -LRB- I was told 30 years ago that would have been my only option -RRB- . After some research and soul searching , I decided I was going to do the masectomies . I did not want this to take over my life and would rather beat cancer before it had a shot . At least this way I would n't have to do chemo or anything . If only ... anyway , long story short , after the next biopsy they found invasive lobular carcinoma in the sample with the fibroadnoma . The pathologist could n't believe what he/she 'd found -- the surgeon never saw it . So , I 'm looking at it as a blessing . I had already decided to have the masectomies anyway , so this made it easier . I 'm scheduleld May 7 to have they girls removed . Hopefully there will be no more cancer , but we 'll cross that bridge when we get there . I will have to take tamoxifin -LRB- ask about that in your case as well as it is also recommended for LCIS -RRB- or have ovaries removed , but I ca n't face that right now . I 'll wait until I 'm healed and a little more sane . I think your doctor has jumped ahead a bit here as it is totally up to you how you proceed with this diagnosis . Please follow your heart as this has to be something you have to live with the rest of your life . My best to you as travel this road . "

0,FALSE,Hey I bought a Sweatshirt that I will wear after my reconstruction surgery Feb 24th that says in a big yellow road sign Forgive the mess UNDER RECONSTRUCTION you might try something like that for the store .

2,FALSE,"Hi . I am an eye doctor . Dry Eye Syndrome causes blurred vision as the day goes on , especially if you are on the computer a lot . with vision of 20/50 and 20/30 , you may just have a normal vision change for the worst : the eyes progressively change in the 40 's and 50 's and people who had great vision before , may begin needing glasses . Some chemo and rads can cause cataracts which also affect vision , but this would not get worse as the day goes on . Cataracts are worse in bright lights for instance driving into the sun or headlights at night . You for sure should see your eye doctor , but in the meantime , go to the pharmacy and get a good artifical tear : the preservative free ones are the best such as Systane PF or Refresh PF -LRB- I am not connected to any company : these are some that I have found work well for my patients -RRB- . A thicker solution , such as Celluvisc gel , is great for bedtime : it will last longer through the night . You must use the drops AT LEAST 4 - 6 times a day to see a benefit . Your dry eye should get better after using the drops consistently for several days . Some times , if your eyes are extremely dry , you may need a prescription to increase your tear production -LRB- Restasis -RRB- , but using the over the counter artificial tears prior to your appointment will not hurt anything and if they are not helping at all , the doctor can prescribe something else . I hope that this helps ! BTW Anyone seeing spots or flashes of lights should be seeing their eye doctor on a regular basis . Also some systemic disease such as Diabetes can also cause blurred vision which is not stable . Good Luck ! "

2,FALSE,"I just became aware that I will have chemotherapy . I have not met with the oncologist yet . I am thinking about my veins . The problem is that they always have trouble finding a vein for an IV . When I had my bi-lateral mx , they had three different nurses , a special light to put on my skin to find a vein and none of them could get a good vein so they gave up , telling me that they would have to take care of it in the OR . So , the thought of going through this for chemo is a little unsettling . Is a port used ONLY for lengthy chemotherapy ? As I said , I 'm not sure how many treatments I will receive . I 'm thinking it is silly to go to all the fuss for a port if I only have four total treatments . BUT , given my veins ... might they consider it ? Any thoughts or similar experiences ? Thanks .

Did your onc talk about that with you ? I 'm glad you 're doing well ! "
0,TRUE,"I do n't know if there is a right or wrong choice as far as total hyster or just the ooph ... just a personal choice . I did it all . I came back a poor metabolizer for Tamox and I made what I consider to be the best decision I could make with the information I had at the time . The ooph was going to put me into early meno , I am 37 , and I knew that with bilateral hormone + BC I would never go through the meds it would take to support an assisted pregnancy so I had it all out . The hormones go with the ovaries and I thought that if I was not going to use the uterus or tubes then they could go as well . I did not want to worry about uterine cancer down the road and looking back this decision may have been made in haste but I do n't regret it . I have had times where I mourn . I had been trying to get pregnant for about 3 years prior to my BC diagnosis and hubby and I tested completely , frustratingly normal as far as fertility was concerned . It just did not happen . I mourn that I will not carry a baby and that without a uterus I can not change my mind down the road about an assisted pregnancy but we are in the middle of our adoption process so parents we will be . Anyway I did do Lupron shots during chemo , to protect my ovaries -LRB- what irony now ! -RRB- , and I just wanted to be done with this mess so I decided on the surgery . I have had little to no side effects , sometimes I pray for a hot flash because it is so freakin cold in my office at work . For me , I decided I had had enough of the female organ cancers and the uterus could go so I would not have to worry down the road . That does not mean I will not get cancer again I know but I will not get uterine or cervical or ovarian . They are off the list . I am comfortable with that . One thing I do know is that we are all so different and everyone makes the right decision for them . Good luck with your decision and know that whatever it is you made the best one you could with the information you had at the time . That is all you can do . There is always great advice on these boards so I know the ladies here , even if they do n't agree with my choice , will be a great help to you . Best wishes . "

0,TRUE,"I went for my annual mammo in January 2006 . the tech who did the mammo told me that they needed to get another view as they could not see everything . She was so calm and matter of fact I was not the least bit worried . Three days later I got a called back to come in for a spot compression mammo and ultrasound - now I am WORRIED !!! I had several mammos and had never been called back before . I had been for my annual gyn exam the month before and gyn did n't feel anything . Ultrasound found two suspicious spots and I was sent for a biopsy . On 2/3/06 I was told that I had BC - ILC and IDC . Then sent for MRI . MRI light up another spot on the right breast , lymph nodes and something on the left breast so sent for more biopsies . Three places of cancer on right breast plus lymph involvement . Told left was cyst . My journey has begun looking for breast surgeon , plastic surgeon , oncologist and tests and more tests . Bilat mastectomy was recommended by the two surgeons I interviewed , so that is what I decided to do - and thank goodness as the `` prohy '' side came back atypical lobular hyperplasia .

0,TRUE,"Hi Cheri and tid . I was away for just over three weeks and got back this morning . Hope you got the information you needed to help manage post op . The Am Cancer Society has lots of great ideas and I hope you connected . This was a long time and I 'm sure lots of things have happened in your families . My experience has been if the docs think things are looking bad , they wo n't say much one way or the other . tid . I was very fortunate and did n't have to do chemo so I ca n't tell you what that was like . There are other threads on this site that have a lot of information and support . You will find no doc can guarantee anything . They can tell you percentages and sometimes what her chances are but every person responds uniquely so it 's impossible to tell ahead of time how she will respond . Mostly this is educated guessing which is why you want a well educated doc and why the more you know the better decision you all can make . What did your Mom decide to do ? If your Mom does n't like and does n't trust this doc , call somebody else although I do n't think any doc can give her what she wants because there are no certainties . The bottom line is if your Mom is ready to let nature take it 's course without fighting back , then all you and the medical system can do is help her through it by accepting that as her decision . That is really hard to do . Watching her go is harder still . It sounds like your Mom was quickly going from bad to worse and staying on top of her medical condition was tricky . Cheri : How did your MIL do with the surgery ? How are you managing with her complaints ? There is no winning when no matter what you do , it 's the wrong thing . For sure , she has plenty to complain about . The lymph node dissection from my armpit was the worst part for me and still is swollen . The radioactive injection was to help locate the sentinel node and the surgeon may also have injected some blue dye . The more nodes the surgeon takes out the harder it is post-op and also increases the risk of lymphedema down the road . Getting her to keep using her arm post-op and not lifting any weights until the doc gives his Ok is important . She needs to do the stretching exercises every day until she has regained normal range of motion and then continue to do them to maintain it . I started doing them in the shower when I was all warmed up . I found a good book about this in the library at my hospital and photocopied the exercises . I started massaging the scars as soon as I could tolerate touching myself and that has helped . I also did a lot of stroking the surface of the skin when the nerves started regrowing which caused a lot of burning pain . Some women experience itching at this time . I still use a little pillow under my armpit and another to keep the seatbelt off my chest when driving . It decreases the vibrations and I lost only 8 nodes . Also I use an ace wrap occasionally very lightly applied.There is nothing easy about any of this . My MIL grew up in an orpanage , too . She had some strange ways of doing things that drove her kids nuts but she and I had a lot in common and I loved her and miss her . She 's been gone 4 years from heart disease . Are you finally over that sinus infection and bronchitis ? There was a bug like that going around that took nearly a month to clear . Please do what you can to take care of yourself , too . "

0,TRUE,"Hi dear , you show no evidence of Metastases , that is `` mets '' , so stop worrying about that . If it ever happened , it would be way down the road , and will most likely never happen . I would get Dr. Susan Love 's Breast Book , I do n't think ILC is rare , I had Medullary breast cancer , which only 5 % of the breast cancers are this type . -LRB- clumsy sentence , sorry -RRB- . But that does n't mean much . With Dr. Love 's Book , just read as far as you need to , the later chapters you will never use and they will just scare you . Take a small tape recorder so you do n't have to take notes . If all your scans and other tests came out good , then forget Mets . That is what mets are , cancer that has gone elsewhere . I presume , with multi-focal cancer , you will have a mastectomy ? Sounds right , then chemo and radiation . You probably will have hormone therapy , because you are ER + & PR + , this is a good thing , but happens later , when all the other treatment is over . But in any case , this is waaay down the road , do n't worry about this part now . This stupid disease is done in stages , which drives us all to drink . Slowly they move through the series of tests , treatment options are discussed , and you slowly go nuts . But when the whole picture becomes clear , all of it makes a lot more sense . Sounds to me like you have a good diagnostic team . Many of your worries they will answer eventually . Just have to play the waiting game and see what turns up . I am 9 years post treatment , am ER and PR Negative , am doing fine and almost went crazy with the slow , step by step `` dance '' that breast cancer requires . Do remember that MOST , not all , but MOST breast cancers when large enough to be found by any means are 8 to 12 years old . So a panicky rush is not the way to go . So what part of the recommendations so far are you reconsidering ? I am just curious . Gentle hugs , Shirlann "
0,TRUE,"Wendy , I have walked down your road before and have a very strong opinion on your question . Zeloda is a magnificent medication and also very effective . Are you aware that it is 5 FU in pill form ? 5FU is a chemo . drug . Zeloda has been by far the least invasive of all the chemo drugs I have been on and I had very good results with it . I stayed on Zeloda for approx . 2.5 years and really beat the beast back . My T.M.s were way down and then the med . stopped working for me . Then of course we tried other hormaonals and when they did n't work , on my way to I.V. chemos . The Zeloda allowed me to maintain my normal lifestyle without weekly visits to the Onc . for I.V. meds . I continued to travel at will with my dose of oral medications . Now , I am not saying that there were no side effects , but they were relatively minimal . Sometimes the pills did n't sit well in my stomach and I had a good dose of hand foot syndrome but it was a trade off . I am now on I.V. meds . 3 wks . on 1 wk . off . The side effects can be numerous and if I want to travel I have to make arrangements with another physician . -LSB- Which is n't always easy -RSB- So , needless to say , I am a great cheerleader for Zeloda and wish that it were still effective for me . Life would be much simpler . If you need to go on any med . that would win my vote . Good luck with everything and I hope you get a long time out of the Zeloda or go NED before that .

6,TRUE,Right back at you . I was tracking every 12 months because things just didnt feel right . Told by the white coats that all was ok . Insisted on ultra sounds and mamograms only to be told it was `` fibrosis '' then to be told by another `` white coat expert '' that there is no such thing as fibrosis of the breast and that all was fine . Ummm then finally diagnosed with stage 3 bc . So much for all the advertising - awareness programes . Yep there are many of the girls in the same boat . We are all mad but we are all now busy fighting to stay alive for our kids . One thing I would like to respectfully point out and that that in Australia the education of BC is started in year 7 at school and so we are all aware of self exams - it is only TOTALLY unforgiveable when the experts tell you there is nothing wrong - after you find a suspicious something - and told it is nothing . It took nearly three years for someone to find it - only by then the growth was huge and I was in stage 3 . Bitter - maybe but I am not alone in this .
0,TRUE,"It 's been a long road since they found my DCIS in April ... since then , I 've had 3 biopsies : needle , ultrasound-guided and MRI-guided . They 've found IDC and atypical ductal hyperplasia along with the DCIS . I 've seen three surgeons and had two differing opinions on lumpectomy vs. mastectomy . I finally have a surgery date for a lumpectomy on 8-19 , but I 'm concerned about the length of time from dx - has anyone else experienced a long delay to treatment while performing tests , getting opinions , etc. ? Thanks . "
2,TRUE,"My father was DX with breast cancer 8 years ago . Even though we have no other family history of breast cancer in my family I wanted to be proactive as it is rare for men to have breast cancer . I had my baseline mammogram when I was 37 and was normal and was told not to come back till I turned 40 . I turned 40 early this year and went for my second mammogram in March 2010 . I received a call back for additional pictures of the Rt breast . Second set of films showed micro calcifications -LRB- 80 % chance of being nothing -RRB- and a subsequent BX showed -LRB- I was in the crappy 20 % -RRB- 8 cm of DCIS in the Rt breast . Scary but 100 % treatable and not life threatening . Had a lumpectomy in April 2010 , and my world took a turn for the worst . Pathology showed 0.4 mm of invasive grade 2 , ER/PR + , HER - cancer with angiolymphatic invasion was reported present on path . Had genetic testing and was BRCA 1 normal BRCA 2 was `` suspected deleterious '' , which meant although not 100 % positive it should be treated as positive . In light of this I opted for a double mastectomy in early June just to be on the safe side and the pathology from this surgery showed to have no additional new invasive cancer since the April lumpectomy and the nodes were clean and negative . Had OncoDX test done and result was 21 , which put me in the low end of the intermediate group -LRB- gray zone -RRB- . Radiation was ruled out since double MX took care of the margins . Primary Oncologist is recommending 4 cycles of T/C due to the angiolymphatic invasion found on the path report in April . She said if that had not been present she would not recommend chemo as the tumor was so small . However , got 2nd opinion from a Oncologist at Stanford , and they said they could recommend chemo but would not push -LRB- as my primary oncologist seems to be doing -RRB- and they seem to be making this determination based upon tumor size even though angiolymphatic invasion was noted . Stanford also suggested Tamoxifan & Zoladex might be a good way for me to go instead of chemo , but my primary oncologist never suggested this . But of course Stanford said there is no right or wrong choice and it is ultimately my decision . That is what I am having a problem with . I do n't have any children and was hoping to try this year -LRB- hence the check-up at my b-day -RRB- when all this was discovered . A fertility DR stated I have a 100 % chance of going into early menopause if I do chemo , which is of course a major concern for me . If I already had kids the decision of chemo would already have been made . However , the reality is I dont and would still like to . So now what do I do . Tamoxifan is a given as both Oncology Drs seem to agree that the majority of reduction of reoccurrence -LRB- 7 % -RRB- will be from the hormone therapy . Meanwhile chemo would only offer and additional 3 % . I would be interested in knowing if any women are in a similar situation as mine . I really and truly do not know how to decide . It seems if I do what my primary oncologist wants I will have to give up my dream of a child that is biologically mine , but if I do n't do chemo and distant reoccurrence occurs down the line how do I reconcile that I did n't do all that I could when I had the chance . Is anyone going through this as well ? "

4,TRUE,"Jen , Yes I did have an axillary node disection after the micromets were found in the sentinal node - 2 days after bilateral mast . My surgeon highly recommended that I do that and I was still in the hospital -LRB- from the bilateral mast -RRB- so it just seemed like part of the ride . -LRB- I 'm not sure what I would have done if I had already been discharged . -RRB- The other interesting thing is that my surgeon informed me that they normally do not test the additional axillary nodes if only micromets were found in the sentinal node , just remove them . However , the surgeon/hospital that I was at still had funding and was doing research on axillary nodes when micromets found in sentinal node , so I was a candidate for the additional testing . The additional 11 nodes removed for me were negative . Even my surgeon disliked the idea of having to tell someone , I believe we should take them out but we wo n't test them and if you want them tested you will have to pay for it yourself - that kind of stuff drives me crazy . Luckily for me , that was n't an issue but I feel for anyone that does run into that issue . Since I had them out I definitely wanted them tested and wanted to know the results . "

There is no reason for you to rush into this surgery until you 've had time to consider all of your options , not just the one your present plastic surgeon has offered . Pedicled trams , as others have said , are an outdated surgery . You 're young , and you deserve the best type pf recon possible - especially after all you 've been through already . There are several techniques that use your own tissue and that do n't require sacrifice of any muscle -LRB- including back muscle -RRB- or the use of implants -LRB- which may need to be replaced down the road -RRB- . I agree with 2tzus . There have been sooooo many women told by their local plastic surgeon that their body type is not right for such and such procedure , only to find out that it was the doc that was n't right for the procedure , not the woman . There 's a great Q & A forum , with questions answered by a world-class plastic surgeon on any and all types of reconstruction and taking into account all types of medical situations , including yours .

So I proceeded to the plastic surgeon.From the minute he touched me and explained the possibilities-I knew immediately that I wanted none of it . I wanted to run out of his office . He was immensely insensitive , also . He said , step into my lab , and took a picture of me naked . Then he literally grabbed and pinched my stomach , and said I had enough fat for a diep , or something . I had to remind him that it was me he was pinching . The whole experience is one I definately want to forget.But it was n't just his manner that made me decide against reconstruction . I am sure there are good plastic surgeons around . I just did n't want the extra pain , or possible se 's . I did n't relish the idea of being asymetrical.But now it does n't bother me at all . I have been fitted for a lightweight prothesis.But for some reason I prefer the little puff that the breast cancer society gave me in the hospital .

Just when you start thinking `` things will work out , I can do this '' , and then you wake up hoping its all a bad dream . It does suck , and it wo n't be easy , but it sounds like you have a fantastic support group at home , and of course you have all of us ! And it sounds like you are a `` glass half full '' kinda person . That really helps . Not that you should or would think all is fine and beautiful , but when something makes you laugh , laugh ! I have always thought when I had my mastectomy , they removed my cancer and I am cancer free . And I plan on living that way until otherwise told . I tell my son everything . Well , not leterally , not `` girlfriend stuff '' . lol But anything serious . I feel he should know things like that . Then its not some surprise or that he would hear something from someone else . I know it would upset me if my mom had something happen with her and she did n't tell me . Which she just tried to do ! But my sister tells me everything cause she knows how I feel . My mom of course thinks I am under enough stress and does n't want to cause more . I love her to death , and will always worry , just like she would . I 'm sure your daughter will be a big help to you . Hugs , hope you are having a good weekend , despite all . Melody "
2,FALSE,"Teenie , the waiting is so hard , I 'm going through it myself right now . I 'm already diagnosed , about a month ago . I 'm waiting for the final pathology report from my removal surgery to see what the next steps will be . However , what I found through this process so far is that when there is bad news , they get back to you REALLY quickly . I got the phone call about abnormal mammo and sono 12 hours after the test , and the MRI results the same day that I had the test . Every facility is different , but that 's been my experience so far . Try to stay calm . One thing to remember too is that a breast MRI lights up everything , which can be good and bad . Whatever the results , you will get through it . It 's scary as heck - the waiting . And your mind goes in a million different -LRB- bad -RRB- directions , but trust me when I say that no matter what they tell you , you will find the strength to get through it . I 'm hoping for good news for you : - -RRB- "
0,TRUE,"Zachsmom : yes , yes , yes ! This week I am & frac12 ; way done with chemo then after that I have reconstruction . Oh , wait , actually I have a TE that I think ruptured so I will have to get a new TE then get them puffed up then recon and then rads . It is a long , arduous road . Also , I hate to admit this but one day after my last chemo my sleep was choppy all night then I got up at 9:30 , had my pills and a Boost and then went back to bed until 3:45 . I was so disgusted to think I had slept half the day away . It is almost embarrassing to admit it . It all takes a toll . I agree with you and you are not losing your mind . "
0,TRUE,Got marked today for my 5 boosts ... I look like a road map !! Only 8 more rads to go !!!!
0,TRUE,"Hi ladies , my MRI is scheduled for 6/27 and depending on the results of the MRI and the onco type dx test they will determine if I have to take the 4 tx of taxol . So I am back in the waiting game and you are right the waiting is the worst part . Has anyone had any problems with sore and tenderness in the nail beds of your toes after a/c ? I am now and it has been 2 weeks since my last tx and it just feels really weird . just wondering if it could be a s/e . also those of you on taxol , I have read the post that states that taxol is alot easier than a/c can you tell me if the down time is the same and and if you feel as bad and thte big ? does it cause the constipation that a/c causes ? well this has been a real emotionally down week for me . and I apologize for not posting sooner just did ` nt feel it was right to bring you guys down . I know that I have a lot to be thankful for and I am so thankful but as one of you already said no matter what some days it just sucks more than ever to have to deal with this , I know that we are all strong and we will all get through this and be better because of it , but some days it is just hard to go through this trial with a smile . thank you all for allowing me tho vent . Hoping everyones test come back fine and everyone tx goes on schedule and no s/e or complications may each day get brighter and better and the road to a normal life gets shorter for us all . those having tx may God bless you and those not having tx enjoy yourself . Blessings and hugs , Renee "
5,TRUE,"Mickey32 - Yep . Sure do have muscle soreness . Tightness , really - If I stretch or bend down or do anything that makes a muscle move , it HURTS . Even a sneeze or cough can make the abs scream for a few seconds . My onc knows about it , and says it can be a side effect . Weakness is getting more intense with each treatment . TX 4 - the last one - is scheduled for the 20th . I am concerned about my side effects . The central nervous system is getting hammered . Have a headache that sends shooting pains from my temples to my feet , mostly at night . Have a new prescription today , and hope it will help . Anyone taking tramadol for headache pain ? Also have sensitivity to hot and cold on hands and feet . Feeling burning sensation on my face . Ears ringing and humming . Chemo brain so bad I did not know what day it was today , and I 'm not exaggerating . Crap - did a TRAIN hit me ? Not to mention all the other `` normal '' se 's . And if anyone has a good recipe for a Mirilax cocktail , I 'd love to know . Tired of mixing that stuff in water and juice . Who has a creative concoction to share ? "
6,TRUE,"1robin - oh your new rescued doggie sounds wonderful . I wish I had one again but with our boat it just would n't work out . Really do n't know what is wrong with me . Am still sick - neausous , faint , dizzy , panting all of the time - so very weak and tired . Would not feel it safe to drive . Stayed in bed all day yesterday . Really do n't know what is happening but I sure feel sick - somewhat like on some of my better chemo days - but all of that should be long past - now figure it must be side effects of radiation ??? "
0,FALSE,"Hi Darlings Thank you so much for your messages , they mean so much coming as they do from the perspective of those a bit `` down the line '' from my position . So we share empathy that 's not patronising or misguide , or embarrsed . I feel strangely ok now . I was told by my the Oncies nurses that I might get 2 more courses of Tax -LRB- they KNOW their stuff -RRB- so I was expecting it , then the results of the histology of he tumour was soooo good . I think I was expecting the ax to fall and that was why I was so weepy after my good news . Thinking `` it ca n't be THAT easy , Netts , not with your luck ! '' I had the Consultant , Mr Yusef laughing . He is Egyptian , quite old and a genius -LRB- he was honoured by the Queen -RRB- , but is quite shy and unsmiling . Well before he introduced me to his young colleague who will he taking over my case I asked to be introduced to his grandson . He laughed out loud , which Angela the BC nurse who was in with me , said she had n't seen often , and rarely in a consultation . I just asked for the lads skin care routine cos he looked like he should be in primary school . It just seems 4 courses when I do n't have cancer in me seems a lot , especially getting Herceprin the day before . Of our group here in Scotland , there only 3 of us who are HER2 + , so no one here has had this kind of tharapy ! Can any one out there help ? They might stop at 2 courses , depending on how I tolerate it , so I have to keep a close diary of s/e , as some of them might become permanent.I think that 's why Martin , my bestest oncy , told me to prepare myself for 2 sessions of `` the yew tree poison '' . That kind of freaked me out !! What s/e might become permanent ??? They reckon the cancer was only about a year old and grew so fast and was n't ` hard ' , except round the edges , so difficult to detect by touch . Anyway , I think they recommend 4 courses as an ideal and I will try to take all 4 . I do n't understand why the Herceptrin is concurrent as the protocol is for 18 courses 3 weeks apart after chemo and rads . So I think I will have to have another 18 after rads as that seems to be the norm . Anyway , I literally trust Mr Yusef with my life . Literally !! Feel more positive now there is another challenge . At least now , I can not be turned down for DLA , -LRB- surely !! -RRB- which will be a huge weight of the finances . Some other bits of good news . My new Irish jig is lovely , really natural and exactly like a designer cut I had years ago , for which I paid a fortune -LRB- I uses to work for an oil company in the Shetland Isles -RRB- so spending was no biggie ... back then ! Anyway , I am really pleased with it , though I love having a cool shower , putting on a lovely cotton nightie -LRB- I have bought some really nice ones , can easily wear them to answer the door -RRB- and putting on a terry towelling head wrap to chill out after a sticky day . Adrinna , the fitter , shaved off the ` bum fluff ' hair on Monday and I have had real hair growing back already -LRB- I look like a Naxi -RRB- ! I will lose it again , of course , but hay ho . the worst of all these things has already happened ! OH lots of silver there where there was n't before , proof that chemo DOES age you !!! Going to lose my lashes again - boo hoo , they were just looking nice , and my nails . They 're horrible just now , but have n't fallen off ! AND my beautiful Dell pink rubberised laptop is fixed . Hurrah !!! And it only cost # 10 , not the # 316 I was quoted elsewhere !! I love that machine more that an inanimate thing has the right to be loved !!! It just needed cleaning of the bloody lemonade and the motherboard tightened . I promise I will never let anyone hurt it again . They will have to wear gloves it they touch it , under close supervision ! My wonderful brother Hugh had it repaired for me . I was going down to Blackpool today for a break before I am back on the treadmill , but was pretty sick yesterday , so will go tomorrow . Need to get all my dental work done before 31st when it all starts again , we were going to stagger it over 3 visits . Wow ! chemo really damages the teeth , minor damage certainly , but I need a veneer as my root canal work has discoloured . I paid # 190 last year to have it internally whitened , which worked too . So that 's the news from the front gals . Feeling quite positive . Always do for challenges and I know this is the best chance of beating this bugger stone dead and THAT 'S motivational . I am a stubborn bugger . AE , how is UB , responding to treatment ? Thank god they got it early . Reassure us ! Sue , Aloe Vera is wonderful for any kind of burn . I have a huge Aloe Vera plant and also a 500ml tube living in my fridge constantly . It 's dead cheap and pure 99.9 % pure - only # 4.99 from Holland and Barrett . Makes a lovely skin moisturiser too , Great as an after sun . But if your burn does n't respond , you have got to go to A & E if it is on your ` at risk ' arm . I was given 2 big leaflets from the hosp when I had surgery . 1 in 3 of us who had lymph removal will get lympheodema and injuries to the at risk arm are not to be dismissed.They might be serious . Please seek help !!! Mel , what a horrible time you have had . What a spiteful , vindictive thing for that arse to do . OK , maybe he got tired storing your stuff , but he could have been decent , explained that to you and given you notice to make other arrangments !!! -LRB- Sorry ! I sneaked ` arse ' through customs ! -RRB- Where are you staying now ? It must be scary not having a roof over your head , tho ' it sounds like you have good support , if not space for stuff . Money worries suck too . I am not a breadhead , never worshipped money , but when there is more going out than coming in ... . stress on a new level.Your outlook , though , is inspirational . You sound like you have the most wonderful son . Lucky old you . Family can see you through ANY troubles . There is n't a day that I take my family for granted for what they have done to support me through all this . Judie !!!!!! Dinnae ! I gasped at your comment too.Had to re-read it twice . Funny , I developed a wee purple frekle -LRB- sp -RRB- on my boob , right over the tumour . Doc said it was nothing to worry about ! Maybe is was n't . Pretty colour it is . Cathi , my next door neighbour and her partner were separated , but amicable enough . One Sunday afternoon he called round to see the kids with his mum and sister , he was really pleasant to me as I was leaving the house to pick up the Sundays , and by the time I got back , 2 cars were screeching away from the house , I was just across the road so did n't see anything but heard raised voices . It took about 15 minutes as the shop is just down the road . Later that evening 2 policemen came to my door to see if I saw or heard anything . I tried to be helpful but did n't see anything at all , and only saw Peter knocking the door , and saw the cars driving away at speed . He had done to Joanne what your SIN did to Jacklyn . Jo was out of the house for 2 weeks and I was worried sick . The house was just empty . She came home after 2 weeks a wreck , terrified of her own shadow . She looked ok by then -LRB- she used Arnica gel on the bruising -RRB- , but they had taken pics and OMG she was black and blue . She too , had thumb marks on her neck , split lip etc and she got the police at once . She had met someone else -LRB- who now living with her and they are very happy -RRB- The red mist just decended on Peter , her ex . Ironic , as had lots of affairs and he left Jo ! -RRB- The case went to trial . I was initially called , but because I could contribute anything , was let off testifying . He was found ` not proven ' - a weird Scottish verdict that means they knew he was guilty but could n't prove it as there were no witnesses -LRB- rational was that it could have been the mum or the sister - they just knew she had been assaulted , and they claimed it was just a fight , not an assault -RRB- I always felt that if I just said I heard her screaming or saw something ... that might have made the difference.The kids heard it all , but the court would not accept their testimony as Jo might have `` groomed '' them . I have always felt a bit guilty for not backing her up be saying I saw something . But that would have been perjury . Anyway the upshot is the he can only see the kids under supervision and they do n't want anything to do with him -LRB- and HE was a devoted dad , especially to Louis -RRB- . Jo is with a lovely guy now who is great to the kids -LRB- and to me - they ca n't do enough for me since my dx -RRB- So there is hope for the future . Just make sure that he fulfils his financial responsibility to them . Your pic was great , we just do n't / ca n't get enough photos of Margot and the kids . How is Jacklyn doing ? Poor lass , she has n't had to seek her troubles , has she ? She has got a great mum though , and I 'll bet the house she knows it ! Has your other daughter and her Horrible Hubby decended on you yet ? Lay down the rules ! It 's much better if people know their boundries , including putting money in the pot ! Long term guests are not cheap !! Ivorymom , Lynda , Jane and all of you . Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support . All of my family and friends thank you for your support as you guys fulfil a role THAT NOBOBY ELSE can !! With all my love Nettie the invincable -LRB- lol -RRB- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX "

0,TRUE,Having just started a new avenue and an unexpected path in my life I now find my self doing a lot of thinking and research . Given two options I am choosing the mastectomy road . My surgery is two days away . Knowing that this is something that must and will be done is a hard one to swollow . However I have one life and keeping my chin up and and knowing I have a good doctor and the love of my family will get me through this . With researching the net I think today which is the day after the bomb was dropped in our laps has helped me better understand what to expect . The not knowing and waiting for the test results was a sure killer on my mind . But now the word is in and I am as ready as I can to jump into the next phase . I am constantly keeping in mind I am not the first nor will be the last going through this . And knowing I am not alone in the long list of survivors of bc . So with that I wait for the big day and move on with my head high knowing I will be added to the list of us who are survivors .

I can not wait another year to have my surgery , I want these rocks out of my chest ! So hopefully they can use what info they already got from me on the trial .

0,FALSE,"Hey Girlfriends , I went to the new support group meeting once a month here in town . There were 4 of us show up but not the gal sponsering it . She did get there later and her dad died this a.m. so all is forgiven . We had a little meeting there in the road in the park . I listened to a couple ladies that really need with a capital Need a support group . I offered my house next Wed.so we could talk . I am not at all a support professional but I figure we are all going through the same things and they need to talk to someone so we can just talk about us . I would n't usually get myself into something like this but I felt so sorry for these gals . They just need someone to talk to , they need each other . I am just giving them a place to talk until they get the other meeting up and going . I think they need it more than once a month though . I guess that will all get straightened out in time . Ya know Janie , I blame everything on treatments and the lasting affects of treatment . Yea , I would of been upset about so much if it was n't for the B.C. I mean theres the stiffness in every bone in my body . I would have been so embarrassed pre treatment if I had to get up from a restaurant table and walk like egor all the way out and just as I get my bones working properly I get in the car so I can do it all again when I get to the next stop and get out . I would have been so worried forgetting everything I ever new but I just wollow in my own egnorance because I will forget how egnorant I am in just a few mins .

Her sister died a few years after dx . and she had a smaller tumor , anyway this lady never went to a support group but thought this would be good for her and she came . I guess we do need one here . She said all these years she never really talked to anyone about it and when she was dx . people did n't speak of it . How sad . Well girls , I watch the show Lost , the guys are easy on the eyes .

4,TRUE,"Hi Apple - I totally agree with everyone here , but I see that you are already in agreement too . Thank God for that ! The only other suggestion I have is to try to EDUCATE your husband about breast cancer . When he says you 're spending too much time online - tell him you are RESEARCHING your disease . Use the word `` disease '' - I 'm finding some men act like BC is nothing more serious than a bad case of acne . They have heard so many `` success '' stories - that they think `` no big deal '' . Has your husband gone with you to your doctor appointments ? Your doctor could sit down and explain to him your risks of recurrence should you choose to do nothing . Some doctors are afraid to spell out in dirty detail what actually happens at the end of BC ... ... so print out the scary scene flyrzfan posted above and show him . Also - if your doctor or nurse can give you written details about what your treatment will be - how long - the side effects - it should help you make realistic plans . I am one who really believes in planning ahead - especially on this roller-coaster ride - better to sit in the front seat with your eyes wide open to see what 's coming than cower in the back !

Watching my friend go through the cardiac failure and have to discontinue Herceptin -LRB- and all other chemotherapy as well -RRB- and watch her cancer metastasize was a good lesson in how awful that situation can be . The weekly lower dose Herceptin has more science behind it , that is the way it was administered in the first studies done , and it reportedly has a lower rate of cardiac issues than the higher dose given every three weeks , although there is no data to suggest that it works any better to control cancer so far .

0,TRUE,I had chemo first because my tumor was 6 cm . I think any tumor over 2 cm is treated with chemo prior to surgery . I responded very well .

6,TRUE,"Fiona condolences on the loss of your son . Basically the less than positive issues are the # of affected nodes , the 2 fairly large tumors , ER , PR negative and HER + . Your oncologist can give # 's but dont let them throw you , you are the only number you care about . The docs will likely so studies to look for spread outside the breast - possibly a bone scan + / - a CT chest abdomen and pelvis to see if the cells settled anywhere else . The HER + means its fairly aggressive but it gives you Herceptin as an option . ER/PR - means you probably wont be given tamoxifen which is used in estrogen/progesterone sensitive tumors . They may even suggest radiation after chemo . Find an oncologist you trust , get a 2nd opinion and go forward . Let people help you and dont let anyone tell you how to feel . Check the boards when you know what your chemo will be - everyone is different but it helps to talk to others in same boat , you can all help row .

0,TRUE,"Dear dee1402 , JMHO I hope you do n't mind my intervention in your diagnosis but I recommend getting as much testing and biopsy done before having just a lumpectomy of one area . From my past experience of being a Breast Imaging Specialist and a Breast Cancer Survivor doctors tend to assume that they will get all ca tissue out with lumpectomy and do lots of time . Get an MRI of your breast that is a dedicated Breast Unit ASAP and definitely before surgery . Even MRI imaging does not show everything -LRB- not the best for any in-situ findings -RRB- but does tend to show enlarged nodes , invasive ca , and potential problems . If you are told that you have very dense breast that can be difficult to diagnose that is a risk of having more going on than they can prove by imaging . We see this all the time at our Breast Center and try very hard to interpret to the very best ability but things still get missed . I do n't want to scare you but do want to help you make good decisions . My ca was missed for sev yrs but I have a very untypical type of invasive lobular ca that I finally found myself 2 mths after Cat 2 Benign findings mammo read by extremely good radiologist . My ca had to have been there for sev yrs because of size and 5 + lymph nodes . So beware of trusting imaging totally . Surgeons tend to trust imaging 150 % and are mostly ultra conservative these days on taking breast tissue . It is wonderful to be able to have a lumpectomy and save the breast but not if you leave cells behind . Br Ca is very sneaky and can simmer for years with no symptoms . Sometimes by the time it will show up on imaging or produce symptoms it is already Stage 3 and you are battling for your life . It is still treatable at this stage but my onc has told me I will never be considered cured even if I live to be 100 . If caught early it can be cured . So just be diligent and get proactive and arm yourself with as much knowledge as possible . If you can find a Dr. who actually is a BR CA Surgeon not just a general surgeon he will be much more cautious and try to really find out what is in your breast . I also recommend seeing a good Breast Onc after MRI and get all results you can to take to him and ask him to review your actual mammo and MRI , Breast U/S , and any other studies one on one with good Breast Radiologist . If you can get these guys looking at a more personal level and talking it is always an advantage . You can get 2nd opinions which I would do before any surgery is done . Sorry for such a long post but I do not want others to have regrets that they did not pursue every avenue to finding ca early and being able to have a cure . Hope this does not offend you and I would be glad to talk with you privately if you would like . You may send me a private message if you have other questions or if would rather I keep my opinions to myself . I will understand because I know all of this is scary and you feel frustrated . Hope everything works out for you and this is just a bump in the road . Whatever you do must be your decision not anyone elses . You must be comfortable with that > Saying a prayer for you now if you do n't mind . God bless you and keep you , LOL , gin2ca "

I also opted for a bilateral mastectomy , but only after tons of research and soul-searching . I have never regretted my decision . I now have my silicone implants and am awaiting nipple reconstruction . I am thinking you are probably ready for your surgery , but just to repeat instructions you may already have received : Make sure you take a camisole with pockets to hold your drain tubes for the trip home , and also have easy to get on clothes like a button-down top and pull up pants . Also , take soft pillows to cushion you from the seat belt on the ride home . Do n't try to think about the surgery too much -- just try to stay busy and keep your mind occupied . It 's really not as bad as you might be thinking . The nurses really made sure I was comfortable afterward and kept ahead of my pain . Good luck to you ! "

It had cleared up on steroid cream but came back full force after the lumpectomy so I am listening to my body . Has anyone else had this rash ?

He said the latest and greatest studies are showing that even just 2 years of being on them decreases significantly the chance of recurrence . I guess I just have to resign myself to the fact that I 'm going to ache being on it and not be able to sleep , but there is a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to . At the end of the year , we will discuss the subject again . So I started taking Glucosamine 1500mg a day , we 'll see if that helps a little with my aches and pains .

0,TRUE,"Couple of thoughts . Good that you are getting a second opinion . -LRB- Get your films and copies of all reports you have so far -RRB- . Find the BEST breast surgeon you can -LRB- not just a general surgeon -RRB- at a major hospital or cancer center . Discuss the pros/cons of options now and options that you would have down the road if it ever comes back . I had an excisional biopsy -LRB- basically same as lumpectomy -RRB- because they could n't do a needle biopsy in my case . Margins were not clear . And there were no guarantees margins would be clear a second time around . At that point I opted for a mastectomy & no radiation . Lymph node test -LRB- SNB -RRB- was done during surgery . They take a frozen section and results come back while you are still in surgery . If negative , that 's the end of it . If positive , they take more nodes . I did not have reconstruction at the same time as mastectomy so that is another whole other discussion to have because there are lots of different methods , coordination w/plastic surgeon , etc. . "

Because I am 39 -LRB- and it sounds like you are young too -RRB- my Dr is willing to do something . My Dr is recommending Xeloda -LRB- pill form -RRB- with radiation and for 4 months afterward BUT I have seen many on this site treated with gemzar/carboplat or avastin/taxotere and I am taking those drugs to her at my appt next week and asking why those are n't an option for me .

6,TRUE,"Neelie - I truly feel for ya . I am in the same boat . Briefly , my story is an abnormal mammo -LRB- calcifications only -RRB- , DCIS -LRB- ductal carcinoma in situ -RRB- on biopsy , lumpectomy 7/26 , ILC 2mm on path report . Have not had MRI and worry about possibility of more unseen ILC . Did not have sentinal node biopsy with lumpectomy since it was just initially DCIS so have to have that done yet . These are all missing pieces to the puzzle just as you yet have missing pieces . SO what this means is that we must have patience , as hard as that is . The whole picture will not be clear until then . Whether you choose lumpectomy or mastectomy is a very personal choice . Personally , I am hoping to keep my breasts and would elect to do lumpectomy and see size , node status etc. . I am thinking I could always choose mastecomy later if news is not good but I am not you and my family hx is negative for BC , and that may not be the best choice for your peace of mind . As far as need for chemo , radiation etc I think you have to wait and see the whole picture with either type of surgery . Best of luck . I wish you peace and patience . - Dobie "

Although the BS was in agreement about the modified Radical Mastectomy , she was firmly not in agreement on the type of surgery offered to me at home .

Then the PS would come in and do the reconsruction by filling my empty breast with an implant , and a year later a nipple would be tatooed with the shaping etc. . At MGH the BS will not leave any breast tissue at all for a few reasons , 1 chance of recurrence , I have many micro spots in addition to a tumor at the 6 o'clock position which was not biopsied , I was not aware of that tumor , and have tumors in every quadrant after all that chemo I was very dissappointed . 2 My body is/was creating clots on coumadin , and I have to inject 100ml of Lovenox every day , 3 my two port failures one was infected shortly after implantation , and the second just broke down inscision would not heal and opened up , 4 I will be having my chest wall radiated after surgery , 5 very high risk of clots with my history . .

Surgery scheduled for 1/26/11 , an overnight stay and I will be on the road home . I am at the acceptance stage now , feeling calm now that I know what will be happening . It was my worst nightmare mastectomy , before all this `` treatment '' , now my worst nightmare is possibility of recurrence . So I am saying goodbye to my breast sadly , but sure of my choice . Living is the desired outcome right ??? I tried to save it and have a less invasive procedure but maybe all that trouble got me here so I could accept that it has to go . My wound care nurse says I have come a long way baby , I was a hot mess back in Sept. now I am doing great . All my best to all of you , looking forward , to seeing cancer in my rear veiw !!! Kaz "
0,TRUE,Lastminute - Thanks for asking . I 'm having bi-lat surgery on Dec. 3 prior to rads . The chemo shrunk the tumor to make it operable and hopefully stopped the cancer from spreading systemically . It seems like a very long road . I wo n't be done everything -LRB- except oral meds -RRB- until late February .
0,TRUE,"She is in so much pain . I also called it a `` bump in the road '' when i was diagnosed . I then realized it wasnt . I call it , `` another chapter in my book '' I have grown up so much since March 22 till now . I never thought i would be so strong today . Robin is in so much shock . Right now she is probably wondering what two months from now holds . The majority of us were likely wondering the same thing when we were frist diagnosed . Sisters , i hope she knows about this site and what a wonderful group of women we are . Love YOU and Thanks for all the support you guys give me . Lets do it also for Robin . "
0,TRUE,"I was reading the news articles last night . The latest articles say that her prognosis is quite good ; however , she made a statement that the road might be a little bumpier than she or her doctors thought . I wonder if that means she may need chemo . She has n't disclosed her treatment yet but in the beginning they were just talking surgery and radiation so a little bumpier may mean chemo is in her future . "
6,TRUE,"I was diagnosed on Dec 20 , 2005 and it was upgraded a month later . It was a frantic month and then a year of chemo . I have been stable the last 3 yrs . You may have been among 12 % to get into this boat but you may be rowing for many years to come . You may in fact be rowing long after your doctor thinks your boat will sink . "
0,TRUE,"Robyn - I just wanted to tell you that my original BS -LRB- I switched BS 's down the road -RRB- told me I had ADH and also recommended a surgical biopsy . After the pathology report came back they said , `` Oh , it 's not ADH after all , it 's DCIS , and we need to go back in . '' -LRB- As Beesie said , they look very similar . -RRB- They gave me a choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy . That 's the point I chose MX , but wanted a NSM so that is why I switched BS 's . I chose MX for all of the reasons vmudrow listed above . After my MX , the final pathology report came back with not one spot of DCIS , but multiple areas that had never shown up on any mammogram , ultrasound or MRI . Anyway , I do n't really think there is much difference between ADH and DCIS . Either way , your body is showing it 's ability to make cells faster than normal . It 's such a gray area as to when the ADH technically becomes DCIS . And no one knows when or if the DCIS can or will become invasive . LIke everyone else says , try to educate yourself as much as possible on all the ramifications of each different choice of treatment and then listen to your heart and what YOU want to do . You have to live with your decision , not your BS , PS , etc. . Good luck ! "

I 'm not even getting upset any more . It 's just one more little bump on this rocky road . We 'll get through it . Continue to check in . This is a great source of support & knowledge . "
4,TRUE,My Diep ended up being a muscle-sparing free tram - but the recovery would have been very similar . I really started to feel well by the time they sent me home from the hospital on Day 5 ... ... until I ended up with bronchitis on day 7 and had to be hospitalized with shortness of breath . Then I was stuck there for another 2 weeks because of the mrsa infection - which set off another roller-coaster ride of complications -LRB- including my abdominal incision reopening and a large incisional hernia -RRB- . So I 'm probably not the best person to ask about recovery times . You could check out my new plastic surgeon 's web site -LRB- he 's with North Shore University Hospital -RRB- www.breastreconstruction.org . He 's fantastic - works only on breasts and is very supportive of breast cancer patients . I 've never heard of a `` partial Diep '' ... ... is this because you already had a mastectomy and need a delayed Diep ? Who is your PS - are you happy with him/her ?

I was diagnosed with dcis in june I had a mastectomy with a pedicle flap reconstruction at the same time . From the time of the diagnosis to the surgery was a month my dcis was a high grade II , after the surgery i have had some complications 2 weeks after i got home from the hospital I had the abdominal incision opened up as i have fat necrosis and has to be packed 2 to 4 times a day it was about 2 inches opened then about 2 weeks ago the same thing happened with the my left breast -LRB- flap -RRB- now this has to be packed twice a day until it closes up too i was just wondering if anyone has had the same problems too . my ps said that 20 % of women have this problem , I feel like this is never going to end i 've been off work since the surgeryas the abdominal incision is as solid as a rock which cause severe pain when doing any type bending , my flap constantly swells on the side where they took the breast some much that i ca n't put my arm at my side . I feel so frustrated and angry that i ca n't see the light at the end of the tunnel . I know that i 'm cured but that does n't make me feel any better , it 's like every where you turn tv , internet , paper its thrown in your face cancer , well i did n't ask for this , is it always going to feel like this or am i just feeling sorry for myself . I did n't have to have any treatments or hormone blockers , sometimes i feel guilty that others are far off worse than i am and i still feel this way . my husband and kids have been wonderful but its hard to talk about it I get emotional so easily sometime i wish that it was far worse then at least then i have a reason for feeling this way .

2,TRUE,"Another one saying GO , GO , GO . I agree with Bethie , that being away from our comfort zone is scary . Not doing chemo is emotionally scary . Giving your body a physical and mental break mixed with a family vacation will strengthen you overall . If your ONC gave you the green light , I 'd say start packing sister . Have a wonderful time . If you are really worried you can always get some med air lift insurance . I think it 's about $ 400 .

0,TRUE,Well Everyone it 's great to know that normal is somewhere down the road . I 'm not feeling bad just kind of yuck if that makes any sense - day 6 after first tx . The energy is certainly not there but it 's great to know that you who have been here before are feeling good now . Made an appointment to get my wig cut next Tuesday and booked enough time that if need be I 'll get my head shaved also . I 've been putting off doing this so step in the right direction . Otter ca n't wait for your info on chemo and Neulasta . Have a great day all .
2,TRUE,Noelle - glad your back pain has eased up . I just find dealing with that takes a lot of energy that we ca n't really afford right now . I checked out your site - what a awesome store you run . You and Sue and everyone else who is working give me the courage to try it myself and I think it will be good for me to get out into the real world - I 'll only be doing part-time but with an hour commute each way its pretty much a full day there . Sue - I really hope you have a fantastic time in the woods this weekend . We are hoping to take the kids camping at least once this summer -LRB- with me at least -RRB- and that is just scheduling it around a good week . We have got tickets to Corteo - Cirque Du Soleil for a few weeks after my fourth treatment . Something for all of us to look forward to . My treatment went okay yesterday and I felt like crap after with my face totally having that wonderful red flush going . I even got a bit of redness around my port area -LRB- not the port itself but a little ways away which I 've never had but gone this morning ? -RRB- That is not how it usually goes -LRB- usually feel like crap a few days later -RRB- but it probably had more to do with my lack of sleep the night before . Not feeling to bad now . I think it does get easier in the sense that you know what to expect and that this stuff is just temporary and you do climb back out of it all . Of course you also know once you start feeling really good then you get to go back and feel like crap again ?? BCS75 - are you every 2 weeks with your treatments ? It is really nice to know that we are half way there and there is light at the end of the tunnel . Will anyone else be going on to radiation after ?

I have all the wonderful encourageing sister at this site to help me along ! It makes me feel blessed and happy ! I am not scared about tomorrow , I know all your hearts and prayers are with me.All the positive vibes feel so good ;--RRB- Thankyou ! "
2,TRUE,"I 'm here with a slightly different perspective . Was diagnosed 4ξ1/2 years ago , had good margins on the first try so no re-excision , small , intermediate grade so no radiation and my doctor said in my case the risks of Tamoxifin outweigh the benefits . I guess you could say I have cancer `` extra light '' or maybe cancer `` extra lucky . '' Yet not a day goes by when I do n't worry about recurrence and not just local recurrence but distant . From the day I was diagnosed until I got that first Lexapro in me 5 months later I cried daily , sobbed is more like it . My doctors were totally perplexed as to why I fell into such a deep depression when it was caught so early and thousands of women would give anything to be in my place . They told me over and over how lucky I was and to get out and get a life . So from the start I was made to feel that I had no right to feel the way I did when others were so much worse off than I . Yet I did feel terrible and I got NO support for this from anyone , family , friends , doctors . The general consensus was that it was small , early and I 'll be fine . Still , I had a hundred unanswered questions in my mind , such as `` how do you know there is no more in me ? '' Just a couple of weeks ago I mentioned to someone that I still worry about this and she said , `` Why ? that was years ago , you were cured ! '' I 'm sure her words were intended to reassure me but they hurt and showed me that she did n't understand . It was as if she thought you can get bc ONCE and I had it my one time and now I do n't have to worry about it for the rest of my life . Because I did n't have a mastectomy or radiation and am not taking Tamoxifin does that mean I have an even lesser bc ? The way I look at it I have an even greater chance of it coming back as I HAVE N'T had radiation to kill those pesky stray cells and I DID N'T have a mastectomy -LRB- or even a re-excision for `` good '' but not `` excellent '' margins -RRB- to remove nasty breast tissue and I 'm NOT taking Tamoxifin to ward off any future occurrences . There is very little support for someone in this position and quite honestly it is lonely fighting the battle alone . My doctor tells me she knows many who have been treated in the same way as I but she ca n't produce one name . The one support group I went to , I left feeling like a complete misfit and at the same time scared to death that I would be back someday joining in on their conversations of chemo and ports . I even feel like a misfit here because I ca n't talk about reconstruction or tamox side effects or sunburn from radiation . What right do I have to complain when others are going through worse things than I ? I feel as if I am supposed to be so grateful that it was caught when it was . Okay , I am grateful , very grateful . But does that exempt me from being scared out of my mind that it will come back with a vengeance in the future ? "
2,FALSE,"Hi Lynn , Yea , that is a long time for the nosebleeds to resolve - and with half the dose , you may or may not develop nosebleeds , so it is really hard to say . However , bone mets do regress - my sternum mets has regressed - it will never be a normal sternum , but my last scan shows it is healing and lights up with much lesser SUV . If your onc thinks stable is the best outcome , then there would be no point of adding the Avastin - he must have thought better response with Avastin is possible . But with your added clarification , I take the initial input back ... but , I 'm the kind that tends to go with my onc advice ... ask him straight-up - `` hey , with my nosebleed situation , do you think there is enough benefit to make it worth the try ????

0,TRUE,"I am a member of the `` lumpectomy only '' club and here 's what happened in my situation . I had a diagnosis of DCIS -- on left breast in July '08 - this was after a digital mamm which showed a cluster of microcalcifications followed by a lumpectomy/surgical excision . Mine was a very tiny , tiny area of DCIS -LRB- 1.6 mm -- Yes that says mm NOT cm - so less than 1/8th of an inch in size -RRB- with nothing identified as comedo and no necrosis and I had clear margins after a surgical excision . I have not had any additional treatment besides my excisional biopsy in July '08 which got all of the DCIS out . At follow up appt . a week after the biopsy , a medical oncologist spoke with me and told me that my tumor was sooo tiny he thought there was a miniscule chance it would cause me problems down the road and he did not recommend radiation therapy or hormonal therapy with their associated risks and side effects for my particular situation . He actually told me I was not to lose sleep over this or worry about it and he never expected to see me again . I also met with a radiation oncologist who wavered a bit on his recommendation , -LRB- seems I was sort of in a ` gray ' area on rad treatments mainly because of my age at time - 46 - and one margin although clear was ` close ' -RRB- but ultimately told me after we had a long discussion that I get a pass on this and with my particular circumstances that if I were his wife , he would NOT treat me with radiation . Therefore , I decided against doing anything more except for close monitoring with mammograms and MRI 's as needed . Since that time I have had both follow up digital mamm on my left side in December '08 and a follow up MRI in Feb '09 as well as a regular annual bi-lateral digital mamm screening on both breasts in June '09 -- with nothing ` alarming ' showing up on any of these monitoring tests . I returned again in Dec. '09 for a re-check on the left breast due to some strange pain and sensations I was having , but after mammogram followed by ultrasound , the radiologist did not see anything of major concern . I am to have another breast MRI probably toward end of this month or beginning of March a year since last one and am fine with being monitored closely -LRB- just do n't find anything more thank you very much ! -RRB- I will have another yearly bi-lateral annual screening mamm on both breasts this coming summer .

2,TRUE,"Gena you are going to be ok . The reality is that many women get those calls and after the full set of tests to make sure there is nothing to worry about they get the - `` it 's benign '' call . You need to keep your focus positive and though it is scary and hard to go through this - the waiting is the worst . It is good they are on top of this and they are checking you thoroughly - that is the most important thing . I am 52 with fibrocystic breast tissue and have had sore and lumpy breasts my whole life - I 've had so many biopsies over the past 20 years I 've lost count - I think at least 8 - until my diagnosis in May - they were all benign . Every time I got the call back or the request to come for a biopsy I felt that scared feeling - hang in there - chances are you will be breathing a huge sigh of relief in another week . Bottom line is - whatever the outcome you will do what you need to do to get through this - in the mean time you do n't know anything right now - no amount of worrying is going to change tomorrow - get some sleep - breathe , think of a beautiful place you 've visited , and visualize yourself there with positive white light surrounding you .

Now I KNOW I 'm not my dad , but darn it , I just can not get that out of my mind . I 'm truly wondering if I should try to find a counselor who deals with cancer patients . What do you all think about it ? I still have that tingling in toes and hands ... they graded it at a 1 , so it 's very low , but still it bothers me . Terry do you know what yours was graded ? Kathleen , I 'm SO glad to hear -LRB- I agree with terry is n't it funny to be glad ot hear you have a UTI ? -RRB- that it was just an infection and not something else . IT had to be a huge weight off of your shoulders . Take really good care of yourself now and let your body heal up a little . GarnetAnn ... you are just ALMOST finished are n't you ? Woohoo :-RRB- Will do a little happy dance for you on your final treatment :-RRB- Linda , I feel like you too , like I should do something , but I live in a small town and I just dont ' know what there is I can do . I 'm hoping something will come to me as I start to feel a little more human . If you come up with any ideas , I would love to hear what you are thinking about :-RRB- Debbie , I 'm so jealous that you have your pool open :-RRB- And enjoy that watermelon and tell us how good it was ;-RRB- Teach , hang in here with us . And even though you are drinking what is required , keep doing it , your body needs the water so much right now . I know you must be very tired , as I was too , although I was n't on the same regimen as yours . But you are almost to that light at the end of the tunnel . My node that was found was like yours , not just little cells , but actually a tumor IN teh node itself . My onc was very concerned , and I think that 's why he 's been so proactive with everything . You are almost done , Teach . And there are many here to provide wonderful support and advice . You are a fighter :-RRB- Cyndi , it 's great to see you :-RRB- You did n't say how you are doing ?

6,TRUE,"Hi everyone , I started out on the just diagnosed part of the discussions but now need all of your help since we are in the DCIS boat . I was diagnosed on Nov. 19 . I had two stereo biopsies on my left breast . The one area was benign , the other was DCIS grade 3 solid cribiform and comedo . I was told it was the best to have blah , blah , blah . I felt pretty calm about the whole thing . It seemed pretty cut and dry . Lumpectomy , radiation , and tamoxifen -LRB- ER , PR + -RRB- . I had my lumpectomy on Dec. 9 . Not too bad and the surgeon told my husband that she took a little more tissue just to be sure . I found out Tues. the path report shows that I did not get clear margins . I was not prepared for this at all . Even the radiologist told me on surgery day as she was placing the guide wire -LRB- so much fun !!! -RRB- that it is such a small area . I met with my surgeon today and she said the `` area '' is larger than she thought . She even used me in her breast seminar yesterday because the mammo , mri , and biopsy did not indicate this . The path says approximate span of 2cm . I am scheduled for my re-excision on Monday . I am nervous because my incision is still tender and she said they will do local sedation . I was totally out mask and all last time . Part of me wonders if I should go with a masectomy . The bad thing about DCIS is that it is usually not a `` mass '' at least mine was n't . Picked up from microcalcifications on a mammo . Is there more in there that we have n't found ? Will radiation get it ? I am just so emotional . Angry , sad , why me . Thank you for listening . This site has been a lifesaver to me . Any thoughts from you would greatly appreciated . "
2,TRUE,"Hi there , Has anyone else had Breast MRIs since being diagnosed with DCIS ? I had my 2nd opinion yesterday-FINALLY - at St Bartholomeow 's hospital in London , England , and Mr Carpenter recommended an MRI to make sure it is only DCIS and not Invasive Disease and also to see whether there is any DCIS in the other breast too . If there is it will mean bilateral mastectomies , if not just the one . But then I suppose if there 's any evidence of invasive disease that will shed a different light on things too . Interestingly , he also said that DCIS IS Breast Cancer when my Consultant at the Royal Marsden refers to it as pre-cancerous cells . "

My brother and his wife arrived the day after a chemo treatment , so of course I 'm going to be feeling crappy . I warned them in advance .

I was hoping that being with family would help , but it has had the opposite effect , and now I 'm stuck wondering what to do . I wanted to do something special with my son , just us two ... but I 'm tired , I ca n't be out in the sun much , so things like parks and museums just exhaust me thinking about it .

0,TRUE,"hope someone can help . . in March of this year I found a small lump in my breast and i went to the gyn that same day . He sent me for a mammo and an ultra sound , i was told it was a cyst nothing to worry about but i could have it rechecked in three months if i wanted to , which i did . Again i was told even by the radiologist herself that it was a small cyst-nothing to do about it . I kept feeling it and took myself to a breast specialist . She did an ultrasound in her office and told me that yes i did have a small cyst-but the lump that i was feeling , which was totally different from the cyst , was never seen on any of my previous tests although she did see it on her screen . she did a needle biop that came back positive two days ago . now I 'm so overwhelmed with decisions - I really like her as a surgeon but she is affiliated with the hospital where i had my tests done and i feel I 've lost trust in the institution , although she said it was very hard to see and since it was only on one slide they probably did n't think anything of it . Does this happen often - could it happen anywhere ?? I wonder if I should keep her as my doc , since I really like her . Also , how important is getting a second opinion ?? I 'm not doubting that I have breast cancer but what are the other pros and cons of seeing someone else ? the specialist said its still an early stage and recommended a lumpectomy . Since i `` m in my 50 `` s and a terrible worrier so I have opted for a mastectomy with a reconstructive tram flap . I have seen a plastic surgeon who explained what that was and it seems like alot to go thru but I do n't personally want an implant . I 'm wondering if its worth going thru for the end results . How many problems will I encounter down the road without my stomach muscles intact ?? I have n't signed any papers yet and nothing is definite but they are p ; anning to schedule my surgery for three weeks from now . I 'm talking things over with family and friends and trying to educate myself but its sooo much in a short while . And although I do want to take care of it asap I want to be sure I 'm taking the right steps and making good choices so that I wo n't regret my decisions later .

0,TRUE,I had multi-focal cancer in my right breast and had a single mastectomy in 07 with a tissue expander . Unfortunately I had to have chemo and rads . I then decided that I NEVER wanted to go down that road again if I could help it so when I had my expander switched for an implant I had a prophylactic mastectomy on the left -LRB- skin sparing -RRB- with immediate implant . They do n't match perfectly but they look pretty good and are perky . I do n't have to wear a bra and I have a d cup . Its really not so bad . I do miss my nipples though .

It was a fabulously easy surgery . I had laproscopic as well and everything removed vaginally . One night in the hospital and two weeks of work and I was ready to get back to life with a few restrictions . I do n't know if this will surgically put you into menopause like it did me but I would say the se 's of that could be worse than anything to do with the surgery .

They went back and tested the specimen from the first biopsy again and it still came back ADH but there was no ADH only ALH in the larger specimen from the excisional biopsy . Due to this I was put on a six month screening program with mammogram -LRB- but no MRI -RRB- . I did ask my breast surgeon if I could also have an ultrasound . Fast foward to Sep 05 . Mammogram was clear but ultrasound found a suspicious mass . Biopsy came back as invasive ductal carcinoma . Opted for bi-lateral mastectomy . Final pathology was insitu and infiltrating mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features -LRB- IDLC -RRB- . I have since had chemo , rads and am on Arimidex and so far so good . I am telling you this because I am one who had ADH and ALH and ended up with IDC and ILC all in the same breast . Also , the pathology on my prophylactic side came back as ALH so it probably would have developed into IDC and/or ILC down the road .

But I just could n't do that . Atleast not yet at this point . But I do pray I am not sorry that I did n't . My husband has been great about it and did say it is my body and my decision . Well if some of you found some anti-nausea meds that worked well for you what did you take ?????? I am still new to this and it is all quite trying but I will get through this !!! Any info might help thanks Dana .
6,FALSE,"Hey Suz , best of luck to DH tomorrow-man bad enuf you laid up and now him too ??? Do you have help ? Terry , as to the steroid , I have taken it and was wired to the max but it did help . Unfortunately , it does cause panic attacks if you have nothing to help like ativan -LRB- but do n't know if that is allowed in your treatment -RRB- . They used ativan as an IV drug in my chemo treatment . The fish I catch this time of year are yellowfin tuna . These weigh in at about 35-40 pounds .

2,TRUE,"Hi everyone , Just had my first taxol yesterday . So far . . so good . I did have a lot more trouble sleeping last night though due to the steroids . My hand feel full and stiff today also . Otherwise , no nausea . Theresa , The AC made me a lot more nauseas and I was very weepy on it . Have n't been on the Taxol long enough to know if the weepy will be different yet . Some of it is everything we have been through and I find my coping skills go way down at night when I 'm tired . Hang in there the first few days are the worst and then the symptoms begin to lessen before the next treatment . I 'm hoping to avoid weight gain like the rest of you . It has been fluctuating some , but since the beginning of the diagnosis and all the surgeries I 've had I 've lost around 35 pounds . I 'd like to lose maybe 15 more and go with the lifestyle changes . I have some arthritis and high blood pressure and I know my body would really appreciate the changes , as would my husband . He is at his high school weight and has been very disciplined about it over the years . I made it through treatment yesterday without tears , actually the entire day . That 's pretty amazing for me . I was at the clinic for 7 hours . Is that how long it take the rest of you ? I do start with blood work and then the doctor 's visit and finally , the treatment . It 's a long day . Congratulations to those of you finishing and looking at completing the reconstruction . There is a light at the end . That 's an encouragement to those of us still in process . Blessings to everyone , Susan "

I had three nodes positive and one onc is pushing rads and the other was unsure , so we 'll se what tomorrow brings . I am still very tired two weeks after finishing chemo , although this week is spring break and no students , so hoping that will help . I have some problem going on in my hip and will have a nuclear scan tomorrow also to see what that is and if it was effected by the chemo . Lots going on . Sleep is difficult also even with meds .

4,FALSE,My feeling about the risk of Lymphadema is as follows ... . . I know I am at risk as I had positive nodes and a mast and radiation . However the benefits of exercising far outweigh the risks of lymphadema . I would rather exercise hard to reduce my chances of my aggressive cancer reoccuring and I fully accept the risk of getting LE at some point . I am careful though ... In ways I never was before . I wear gloves to garden and hate them . I try to wear gloves to wash dishes . I wear a sleeve flying or on long car rides . I take my sleeve when hiking but find that using nordic poles stops any feeling of heaviness in my right arm .

2,TRUE,My original biopsy result showed a grade 1 tumor between 13mm and 17mm .

I thought they were the same thing . Can anyone shed light on this ? Thanks you .

2,FALSE,"Got back from Glendive this morning . Got all my junk unloaded from the jeep and brought it into the yard and used the battery cables to start my pickup which has been parked in yard with a dead battery for the last month .

Did n't dare start the pits on fire tho because although the ground and the grass is all wet -- it 's very windy and with my luck a stray ash would blow over and burn up my house or barns . I 'll wait til the wind subsides and light up the pits . Then while I had the pickup running , I drove to town and got gas put in it . I made the mistake of taking my dog in the cab with me . He turns into `` Hooch '' when he rides in a vehicle . You 've never seen so much slobber in your life and it 's SO slimy .

2,FALSE,"Thank you , all of you . I think that myofascial release may be the answer . I 've noticed that the scar area on the inner breast or rather inner chest area is loosening up a bit . Mt doctor 's nurse practicioner told me to wait awhile longer . I 've also had this strange occurrence with my right hand being , at times , much colder than my left hand . Also , my arm hurts when this occurs although there is no swelling . She said it may be the nerve and it will probably regenerate with time . I 've had other surgeries where the nerve has been compromised and did , in fact , return to normal after some time . She also said to wait to see how the scar changes within the next few months . I am to see my surgeon in Oct when I have a mamogram . Besides the scar , I know just how very fortunate I am . I do not have to see an oncologist and I need no further treatment . I just do n't like the scar ; I have always been very conscious about my body . I am 64 and still wear a size 2 . I am too thin to have reconstruction using my own tissue , and I feel too old to electively undergo the long surgery even if I did have enough fat . Both reconstructive surgeons told me that because of my body type , saline implants would wrinkle and because I am allergic to so much , I would n't take a chance with silicone . Also , I did not like the idea of so many surgeries and followup MRIs . I 'm waiting for someone to come up with growing me another breast , although someone pointed out to me that a new breast still would n't match my old breast :--RRB- I find myself molding light fluffies ; the silicone prosthesis is still too heavy to wear , feels as though my chest is going to pull off with my bra . This all takes some getting used to . "

I guess just seems if you ca n't do a chemo b/c of the SE 's would it be worth it to try doing the chemo with the supplements and see what happens like later down the road if you feel your options are running out .

0,FALSE,"Not one person here has said that all cancers are identical - just that the emotional and the physical battle we wage is tough on all levels . Believe me when I tell you I 'm grateful for my early stage diagnosis , but I still see my onc every three months for blood work and have the same anxiety as any cancer survivor when I get a backache , headache or any ache that seemingly comes out of nowhere . STATISTICALLY , I know I probably wo n't die from BC , but my mother thought the same thing . Four and a half years after her initial DCIS diagnosis we were picking out a headstone . So , I may not KNOW that BC is what will probably cause my demise , but it still is THERE , like one of those cartoon anvils that always bops the hell out of anyone trying to get the Road Runner . I do n't expect anyone who 's never had a cancer diagnosis or watched someone they love go through it to `` get '' that , but I do expect folks here to . That 's what got me so riled up . So , MOTC I DO understand your point/perspective . Just please know that because we `` early stagers '' get the `` just '' crap from our doctors , support groups and almost every freaking place else so damned much , some of us are a bit touch sensitive to it . Stage 1 may not be quite as devastating as Stage 4 , but it still has to be dealt with , as well as all the emotional and psychological baggage and fallout that comes with it . Now , as far as Dorothy Hamill - the general public will probably NEVER understand that there even are different types of cancers because they have n't been thorough it - just like the subtleties of Alzheimer 's escaped me until my grandmother was diagnosed . I 'm sure there are tons of people who say Melissa Etheridge performing on the Grammy 's a few years ago and thought `` How bad could it be ? She 's up and about and looks none the worse for wear except her hair . '' That may well always be the case - and as a result , I could give a flying fig about what Joan and John Q Public think about the whether the faces of the celebrities brave enough to have so public a battle with bc look like they 're suffering enough . Remember , Dorothy Hamill is a seasoned athlete who is probably in better shape than 3/4 of the country . Just because she has the audacity to attempt to return to normalcy by rejoining Ice Capades as soon as she can does n't mean she had `` cancer lite '' or that her BC journey will be any easier than anyone else 's .

0,TRUE,Hey mrsb45 ! Thank goodness your almost done ... it 's a long road ... I had 4 AC and 4 Tx and my hair sounded just like yours . Mine kept right on growing ... I could see my scalp too until it started getting color and thickening up . I 'm 4 months past chemo and it 's about 1ξ1/2 inches long and curly . -LRB- was poker straight before chemo -RRB- . I take zinc ... because my doc told me it was the hair 's natural fertilizer . I hope this helps .
2,TRUE,"Ladies , thank you so much for the virtual hugs and kisses as well as the well grounded advice . I am going to talk to my rad doc about the CoQ10 as that sounds like the ticket . He told me not to take any anti oxidents during rads but only have 7 more days til the end ! Yeah . If it does n't work maybe they can spread the herceptin out over a longer period . If not , I believe that I have had enough as Bluedasher pointed out in the various studies with different optimal time frames . I have given it up to the universe , God , the higher power and I trust my Docs to take care of my body . Denali , love the pic of you and your daughter at your chemo grad ! You are absolutely gorgeous and she is too . It is a proud feeling to know that you made it thru chemo . For me , it was the most difficult thing I have ever done.I do n't think anyone can understand what it is like unless they have been thru it . You did it with great strength and compassion . Lisa , I sure feel for you . I agree with gramma that what you are going thru sounds a lot like menopause x 10 . First consider that most of what you are feeling is your hormones and that the rest of the world does n't see you in the same light . Lack of sleep , HOT FLASHES , baldness , and weight gain are enough to put anyone into a funk . I think that you should talk to your doc about Effexor . It seems to have helped many women on this board with the hot flashes and it also has anti depression qualities . Of course feeling like this is n't you !!! It will get better and you will feel good again . How was your visit to the chinese doc ? Are you going to try the accupuncture ? Hang in there Lisa , you have been my rock thru this BC bullshit !!!!! Love , maja "
6,TRUE,"I would love to know if there are other women who had a high oncotype score , like me . I feel like the lone ranger . I was diagnosed 2 years ago at age 65 and had an Oncotype Score of 36 or a 24 % chance of distant recurrence . After reading all of the posts which talk about Oncotype scores , I started wondering if anyone else had a high score . I was Stage I , had chemo -LRB- Taxotere/Cytoxan 4 rounds -RRB- , radiation -LRB- 25 + 8 boosts -RRB- , and am on Arimidex . I was told that by having the chemo followed by the Arimidex , my recurrence percentage would decrease from 24 % to about 14 % . I believe that 10 % drop is significant . However , I worry quite a bit about recurrence . Is there anyone in the same or similar boat ? Thanks . "

2,FALSE,life pretty much sucks sometimes does n't it - and not having much support from your family obviously increases your sadness and frustration - i 'm sorry you are going through so much - i to have suffered many losses and setbacks in the last 5 years - in october of 03 my youngest sister passed away - she had been abusing drugs and alcohol for years but as a family we continued to try to help her - espeically my father who did everything he could to save her life but the damage was too great and she died at only 41 years of age - my dad was devastated - you are not supposed to lose a child - especially your youngest and he was already dealing with taking care of my mom who was well into the last stages of alzheimers - he caught a cold which turned into pneumonia and he died december 27th 2003 - it was unbelievable - a sister and a father gone in less than 3 months - i took time off to help care for my mom and on my first day back to work someone ran a red light and totaled my car - i was out of work for 6 more weeks -LRB- thankfully the guy that hit me had to pay my lost wages -RRB- - then we had to put our 11 year old lab to sleep then in october of 04 i was dx 'd with breast cancer - ok i said to God - this is pretty much all i can take then my mom passed away in may of 05 - this has to be the end of my loss and sorrow i thought - i have buried my sister - my father and my mother and battled breast cancer but no - i was not done as in august of 05 i was dx 'd again with breast cancer -LRB- other breast -RRB- and went thru all the treatment again - i can not seem to recuperate physically or emotionally - my health problems are a long laundry list just like yours and my sadness is deep dark and unrelenting - so i can honestly say i know exactly how you feel - i wish i had some words of wisdom but all i can say is take it one day or one hour or one minute at a time - whatever you need to get by - walk through the fear but learn to depend on yourself - there is really no one else is there ? keep the faith ladies

After a summer to think about it - i am going for a mx - because , i just wo n't be able to know how to evaluate future mamos that show calcs - I am wondering if i am hoping for more tumors to be found in the mx breast when they test it ??

0,TRUE,"I have several posts on here regarding this exact issue . When I was told lumpectomy and radiation , I was fine with it until the margins came back clear but not wide enough for radiation , and grade 2-3 .

After weeks and weeks of agonizing over what to do , I cancelled my re-excision surgery and opted for a bi-lateral mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction . I woud n't have imagined coming to this decision but for me , the worry of a recurrence and the possibility of it becoming invasive or getting it in the other breast , was more t than I could handle emotionally . I met the plastic surgeon yesterday and got to look through his `` album '' of his work . I must say that the results were absolutely amazing . In most cases other than the scar lines , you would n't be able to tell the reconstructed breasts from natural ones . I also saw that the ones that were done after radiation were not nearly as good because of the condition of the skin . I know that I am facing a long and probably difficult road to full recovery but am looking forward to no more mammograms , no more fears , and putting this all behind me . Is it right for everyone ? No . I waffled back and forth for weeks and weeks and just felt uneasy all the time . When I finally made a firm decision on this plan , I felt like a ton had been lifted off my shoulders .

Say you do have recurrence or mets , life can often be prolonged in each case with treatment . Maybe life can be prolonged just long enough to slip you the cure . I know everybody has to die of something , but like so , so many people I 've had family who have died of cancer . I watched my grandmothers and my brother die of cancer . I really would prefer I get a different destiny and I 'm going to hold out for that . That said , I often feel the same way . A friend of mine -LRB- who does n't have any health problems -RRB- says `` We are all in the same boat . '' I feel like well , maybe , but I 'm sitting closer to the exit . Now listen to me . LOL . What a rollercoaster ride . OK . My friend 's stepmother had Stage 4 bc . I do n't know whether she was triple neg or not , but Stage 4 mets to bones . The doctors told her they could n't do much more , but she could try a something along the lines of transplanting bone marrow -LRB- I think that 's what it is -RRB- , anyway , it was over $ 50,000 . She said forget it , joined the Hemlock Society , and moved away to a new house with her husband - 14 years ago .

0,TRUE,"Beanius - I agree with Mari , you really need to complete the antibiotics , all 10 days . Otherwise , you can just reduce the infection and allow the bacteria to become resistant and stronger . The infection can come back even worse . As your immune system is going to be somewhat compromised with chemo , you do n't want to have any active infection . If you are getting clobbered by yeast , I would definitely put in a call to your doctor and ask if you should take Diflucan . I am prone to yeast infections with antibiotics and my doctor ALWAYS gives me a RX for Fluconazole -LRB- I think that 's the generic version -RRB- at the same time . It is one single pill and works for several days . I 'm sure they would just call in a prescription . Golly , if it is not one end we are worrying about , it 's the other end ! With the acidophilus , make sure you take it IN BETWEEN your antibiotic doses . It will re-establish the good bugs the antibiotics kill . If you take it WITH antibiotics , the antibiotics just kill it . I always tried to take it a few hours AFTER my antibiotic . I know you are anxious to get this chemo show on the road .

0,TRUE,Depending on what your job count on being off for six weeks or more . If you try and go back before recommended you will only make things worse and possibly as a result extend how long you will have to be off . I know its a horrible thought but take it a day at a time and you WILL get through it . Depending on how you cope iwth the chemo and radiation you will also most likely need to take time off during and after those as well . Its a rough road but one well worth travelling . Hang in there . We 'll be here when you feel the need to rant and scream .
2,TRUE,"jackieb11-I understand how you are feeling ! I had a right mastectomy on June 13th and had my last fill 3 weeks ago . Most of the time I had 100cc 's put in at one time and paid for the 3 to 4 day back , rib , and spine pain afterwards . Sometimes I could n't walk , sit or stand comfortably . When I had a couple 50cc fills the pain was tolerable but then I kept thinking about how much longer it would take to get the fills over with . I just wanted to get it done . I too went back to work full-time , but I am able to move around alot and find that stretching every hour really helps with the stiffness . I am scheduled for my exchange surgery in October . If the pain continues to be a problem your PS can remove some of the saline and you can have it replaced slower over a bit more time . I have also found that the discomfort has decreased considerably for about a week know . I think my body has started to accept the stretching process . Also , do n't be afraid to take your pain medicine and your PS can also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxer . Hang in there . It will get better . As far a coping with the journey through all of this - I try to keep myself really busy so I do n't have time to think about what may be in the far away future . Just take each day at a time and do n't overwhelm yourself with everything that may happen down the road . I try and look at the light at the end of this tunnel as the upcoming exchange surgery .

I had a two-year old at the time but my husband and I wanted another child . I made the decision to go forward with chemo , based on two things . First , I did not want to have ANY regrets down the road and secondly , my oncologist strongly advised it because of my young age and because I had a two-year old that I needed to be around for . I took her advice , and did 8 rounds of chemo . It was n't fun , but it was n't horrific either . I am glad I did it and frankly , if the beast ever strikes me again , I would do chemo again . Unfortunately , my oncologist also strongly advised against having any more children because of the effect the increasing estrogen would have on my body in regards to a potential recurrence . If I were in your shoes , I would look into having some eggs removed and kept cryogenically , then go forward with chemo . Once treatment was over , I 'd reevaluate with my physicians whether to go forward with pregnancy . As another woman posted , there are many ways to have a family .

I went into a panic mode every time I took that little white Arimidex pill , then I would fly into an irrational rage , that I would have to take this ridiculously expensive pill for years . I was a wreck about it . More scared about this than surgery or rads . After no help from the onc or nurses , who basically told me to just give myself time , my radiologist said , why do n't you just wait until you are done with rads . I felt such relief that someone was telling me to take the time to make this decision . So I stopped taking the pills . It was like a huge weight off my shoulders . I never felt that this pill was going to help me , I just felt it was going to cause more problems . So I realized that my body was telling me to take a different road . I decided to balance my hormones with good nutrition and exercise , which I had never been diligent about before . I feel healthier now than I did before bc and I also feel that I have control of my health . I truly believe that my body has the power to heal itself , as long as I give it the right nutrients .

Actually , my back feels better than it has for years between the rads and pain patch that I am on . It took awhile and having to constantly increase my pain meds before I was put on the patch but that has really helped me with my pain when the other pain meds did not work properly .

I whinned so much they decided to keep me on and bump someone else . I just could n't go through this night of no sleep again . Ok got there went up bravely to the check in desk and the nice lady behind the glass said , `` that will be $ 1,000.00 for your co-pay '' .

I went to the member services and they looked it up on the computer and yep that was the co-pay ... many more tears cause I needed to get this done today .

I drug home and the oc called and the MRI did not exactly show the tumor , but she think she sees it behind these huge lymph nodes . She finally gave me a dx ... Locally Advanced Breast Cancer stage IIIA . At least 4 lymph nodes if not more involved . So ok gals help me figure this one out . Anyone in here with this dx or similar ? The reason they want to do chemo first aggressively is if they operated right now with the mass so large they may not get all the cancer , and they also want to get those cells that are out there in the body floating around .

I 've stayed there and not minded it . It 's almost across the street from Caesar 's which has the Cheesecake Factory . If we were going to plan something for very soon I would pick Vegas because Chicago is terribly cold and nasty through about March . From spring onward , I 'd pick Chicago because Vegas is scorching after May . There are some hotels not too far from the Loop that can be reasonable .

2,FALSE,"Hi Kellymarie , RoseG and Shirlann have both offered you good advice . You 're in a bit of an unusual situation . The good news is that axillary nodes may swell due to lots of conditions , as simple a cat scratch infection , to chronic infections causing them to be reactive . Only about 1 % of breast cancers present in what is called a clinically occult state , meaning axillary nodal involvement in the absence of a finding in the breast . A MRI however , may change this percentage , and it seems wise to have this done , but I 'm not sure of the timing . You mentioned some thickening of the left breast , so the value of the MRI would be to focus in on that area to ensure there is not an occult cancer present . The main approach with a negative mammogram and breast ultrasound and palpable nodes is to biopsy the nodes as your surgeon and as Shirlann said . This does pose a risk of lymphedema by virtue of the biopsy , yet tissue is mandatory to ensure no cancer . If you did the MRI and nothing was evident , you still would need to have the axillary nodes biopsied . If you did an MRI and there was a positive finding , you could have , under anesthesia , a wire guided MRI biopsy for diagnosis , yet the palpable lymph nodes , being enlarged , it seems would still need to be biopsied . One other test which I think of is a radioisotope scinti-mammogram : a small amount of radioactive tracer is injected into a vein , it circulates through the system particularly highlighting breast , and lights up a hot spot in the breast if present . All of these tests have false positives and false negatives , but this test comes to mind because of your rather unusual situation . So , the MRI and the radioisotope scinti-mammogram are two more tests from which you may benefit ultimately . I hope your axillary biopsy is B9 ; perhaps it is related to the hives presence some six months ago . Wishing you well , Tender "
2,FALSE,"Sherry - Just like Tina said , the tattoos are so tiny I can barely find them . They mark the boundaries so they can line up the radiation field . They line it up visually with red lights before they turn on the radiation . In my case they used a tiny syringe with the teensiest needle to inject a dot of black ink . Have you ever had a TB test where they barely put the needle under the skin ? That 's what it is like . Even my techs have a hard time finding my tattoos and usually darken them with a Sharpie pen to see them better . After all you have been through , this will be a breeze for you !

For all of you who think it is amazing that I can walk 40 blocks , I think all of YOU are amazing ! Keep in mind that I had CMF chemo which is not nearly as brutal as most of your treatments . You will all get stronger and and more energetic , little steps at a time . Just keep moving in the right direction and think of how far you have come ! "

0,TRUE,"Kasey , Sorry about the mixed results , but the good news is that the lung mets are shrinking and bone mets are VERY treatable . I was on abraxane and avastin for almost 11 months and had really good results . Unfortunately , like most chemos , they did n't remain effective as long as I would have liked ! But there are lots of options . My hew cocktail is currently busy killing cancer cells . Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right combo . Hang in there . It 's a bumpy road we travel , but at least we are here to smell the roses , too . Hugs , Jeanne "

6,TRUE,"Hi Ace . I think about you from time to time . You sound well and less anxious about tamoxifen . I wish that none of us were in this awful boat , but we are . Tamox has been ok , not great , but very manageable . It 's been a year for me . I do get mood swings from it , which I have never had . Mostly , teary and sad feelings but they pass . When they do n't pass , I will get on Lexapro again or try effexor . What has your doc said about wellbutrin ? Are you going to stay on it or try something else ? I hope the best for you . My onc feels that women with DCIS , even the low grade , small lesion that I had , wreck more havoc on their bodies with worry of the future .

0,TRUE,"Hi ! I had posted on the Aug. board but want to second the positive exchange comments here . I had my expander exchange last Fri 8/7 . I had radiation to both sides so had to wait 6 months after radiation ended for surgery . I had nodes removed from both sides but have had iv 's in left arm since without problem . They took BP 's in ankle in surgery . I had iv sedation so was asleep but no tube in my throat . I did have nausea issues the first day but none after . I had vicodin the first 3 days then have only needed advil . My PS wants me off work for 2 weeks but I can see where people can go back after one if they do n't lift -LRB- I ca n't lift more than 10 lbs for 4 weeks -RRB- . It is a hassle sleeping on my back again -LRB- for 2 weeks -RRB- and wearing a sports bra 24/7 for 4 weeks ... The expanders were so hard I never wore a bra for months . BUT ... the new implants are sooo soft and right away I could breathe easier . My back does n't hurt like it used to either . I also have great range of motion with my arms - nothing like after the mast . I had gotten so nervous before surgery but am so relieved at the results . I had been expanded to 575cc and had implants mentor high profile 650cc placed . I had been told the profile will never be like real breasts but they look good . I am thankful to these boards for the info I got about implants . I think it helped me explain what I wanted to the PS . I told him I wanted to be bigger than the expanders , not smaller . I think I would have been disappointed if I had n't spoke up . I had been a 36/38 DD before so this is a change for me but I am happy . The best part is having this surgery behind me !!! I found out that they do the nipple and tatoos at this ambulatory care part of the hospital . The nurse said they have a whole table with ink colors for tatoos ! That will all be down the road . Good luck to those having surgery soon ! "
2,FALSE,"http://society.guardian.co.uk/cancer/story/0,,1397219,00.html Finding out that she had breast cancer was a terrifying bombshell , of course , but at least Melanie McFadyean encountered a few new truths . Blondes do have more fun , graveyard humour helps but funeral manners from the well-meaning are a pain , and whatever you do , do n't believe the statistics Saturday January 22 , 2005 The Guardian I thought it would n't be me . I even ignored the reminder to get a mammogram . Many people I knew had had breast cancer , so I mistakenly imagined that the law of averages was on my side . I was foolishly confident that their collective misfortune somehow protected me . My best friend at school has had it . Of four close women friends of 25 years , two of us have had it . Of four of us sharing a flat at university in the 1970s , one has died from it and I have had it . Of four of us sat together at the Guardian 15 years ago , two of us have had it -LRB- and a third has died of lung cancer -RRB- . Of four of us who shared childminders , three of us have had it . When I tried using it to get out of a parking fine , the woman on the end of the phone would n't play ball - she had just come through it . One night last March , I went to sleep wondering how I was going to fit in a million things the next day , including going to a party for the colleague who 'd had breast cancer and was giving up work . I woke at 3.30 am with my finger on a lump , as though someone had crept in and arranged my hand as I slept . I was lucky . I caught it early . In the aftermath of diagnosis , I found myself on edges and in abysses I had never been to before . But as terrible as it was , it was never boring . It became a project , a journey , a new way of understanding myself , others and the world around me . There are things I would never have known or experienced if I had not had breast cancer . 1 Breast cancer does not , I learned , carry an automatic death sentence . When I was told I had it , I wept at the thought of leaving my son , my partner , my parents , my family , my friends . Thoughts ran on : I did n't know how to do anything but be alive , how would I do being dead ? You ca n't be dead . Dead is not being . Helpfully , between crying jags and bouts of bewildered why me-ism , tumour humour kicked in fairly soon . I started to worry about the music at my funeral , and to feel cross that I would n't be there to enjoy the attention and hear people saying they wished they 'd given me more of their time and love . I wanted them to listen to a lot of sad music : You 're Gon na Make Me Lonesome When You Go -LRB- Bob Dylan -RRB- , Nobody Does It Better -LRB- Carly Simon -RRB- , J'ai Perdu Mon Eurydice -LRB- Gluck -RRB- , Dream A Little Dream Of Me -LRB- The Mamas & The Papas -RRB- , You Send Me -LRB- Aretha Franklin -RRB- , Fairytale Of New York -LRB- The Pogues -RRB- , Anywhere I Lay My Head -LRB- Tom Waits -RRB- , A Thousand Kisses Deep -LRB- Leonard Cohen -RRB- , I Get Along Without You Very Well -LRB- Nina Simone -RRB- , Where Do You Think You 're Going -LRB- Dire Straits -RRB- and , to show what a really nice person I am , the last one is C'mon Baby Let The Good Times Roll -LRB- Janis Joplin -RRB- . 2 The sudden threat of death forces you to live in the moment , a skill I have never had and often envied in others . In the late 1960s and early 70s , those hippies lived in the moment , man . I , meanwhile , leaned on the wall in my bell-bottom jeans , smoking a joint , pretending to inhale and worrying about the future . For most of us who live in the affluent western world , the future is predicated on some sense of certainty - but after cancer your relationship with certainty vaporises . `` Nobody 's future is certain , '' people say , anxiously searching for words of comfort . `` I might get run over by a bus tomorrow , '' they continue . It 's always a bus and always tomorrow and they are always getting run over . I have never heard of anyone getting run over by a bus , although one friend assures me it happens regularly in Islington . 3 Being ill has been like a journey through challenging landscapes without maps , compasses or sensible footwear . It has been tough and frightening , and brought me face to face with doom , but it has enlightened me and has allowed for moments of extraordinary happiness . With our Anglo-Saxon stiff uppers , our socks heaved up to our armpits and our ramrod backs , we do n't have the vocabulary for the big emotions . The Germans have the word for the doom and agony - weltschmerz - and the French for the happiness - joie de vivre . In English , if you talk about world pain or joy in being alive , everyone looks embarrassed and starts fiddling with their mobile phones . I felt these big emotions - they would come suddenly out of nowhere and consume me . 4 When people hear you have cancer , they foresee a death foretold . Cancer is the plague , the pestilence . They do n't know that , although tragically too many still die , the survival rate for breast cancer is pretty good . I would never have guessed the best reactions to the news that someone has cancer are the batty , the jokey , the level-headed , the irreverent or the understated . One friend sent an email that made me laugh even as I stalked about in the shadows : `` Love you , man . '' I met a friend in a car park one day . She put her arms around me and , stamping her foot and projecting her voice -LRB- she 's an actor -RRB- , bellowed across the car park , `` Fuckit ! Fuckit ! Fuckit ! '' Someone else asked me if I was sure - had I been to the doctor , she wondered . As I went into chemotherapy , Paul Ellis , the consultant oncologist who treated me at Guy 's hospital , said he would be shaking my hand when I was 100 . It was the best thing he could have said , even if he does say it to all the girls . We do n't know how to react to being told someone has cancer . I am sure I have got it wrong in the past . We lapse into graveside manners . It 's terrifying - the hand on the arm , the head on one side , the funeral eyes , the hushed tones - as though you are already on your way to the undertaker 's . However much this plunges you into gloom and fear , you smile and offer comfort because these people are being kind to you . Occasionally you snap , then feel guilty for months . 5 Worst of all is the intrusive questioning . Just when a bit of stiff upper British restraint would go down very nicely , thank you , several people asked me , `` What is your prognosis ? '' One asked if it were good or bad . Supposing it were bad - and luckily mine is not - would I have wanted to go into it ? At least nobody asked me what one woman I know was asked by a friend : are you going to pass away ? 6 Cancer , I learned , is capricious ; no two cancers are the same . Several people responded to the news by telling me about their friends who had died of cancer , which rocketed me into renewed terror . One woman said her best friend had been `` riddled '' with it . A bloke in Greece , where we went on holiday , pointed to three houses in the valley below us , detailing the cancers that had killed their inhabitants during the preceding year . Oh ! Really ! My goodness . How interesting , pass the olives ... 7 You can not imagine what it is like losing your hair , nor overestimate its visceral horror . Two weeks after the first dose of chemotherapy , it started coming out . It was everywhere - in the food , on the floor , the pillows , my clothes . There was so much of it you could have stuffed a three-piece suite . Three weeks later it was almost all gone , except for a few random wispy clumps . I stood in front of the mirror and saw the younger brother my father never had , an old man , his skin yellowing , his eyes pained , his mouth trembling . Then I saw a woman from the old Bedlam . No amount of tumour humour was getting me out of that one . A friend happened by . She sat beside me as I pulled out the remaining hair - it came out very easily - and put it in a plastic bag . I was crying and , she told me afterwards , she was , too . When it was done and all that was left was a few crew-cut spikes , she took the hair to the dustbin , a kind of ritual . One summer 's day as I walked in the park , there was a sudden downpour . I was soaked within seconds . But the funny thing was my visibility was reduced to about a millimetre because , having much reduced eyebrows and eyelashes , I no longer had built-in natural windscreen wipers . I was blinded by the rain . The four chemo treatments were spaced every three weeks from May to July . For several days after each one I 'd be bedridden - green , yellow , grey - as sick and sad as a lush after a liquor binge in a heavy sea . Then , as the drugs wore off , I felt well enough to loll about in the sun in my back garden surrounded by exotic plants - a banana tree , a New Zealand ponga , a towering wild flax . So , ironically , I had a tan . 8 I have dark hair and had I not had cancer and gone bald , I would never have known how much fun it is being blond . I bought a cheap but stylish platinum wig from World Of Wigs . My son said I looked like Pauline Fowler in EastEnders . I sometimes cover my driving mistakes with rude hand gestures , but as a platinum blonde I had no need . One day I did a routine 25-point turn in a main road , holding up 17 different kinds of SUVs , double-deckers , pantechnicons and motorbikes , all , as it transpired , driven by men . Normally this would result in slanging matches in which the C-word would be spat at me , accompanied by threats of violence , but they all smiled indulgently and let me get on with it . It did n't have the same effect on other blondes , however . One I tangled with actually chased me at speed , zooming alongside in order to hurl an object at my head - luckily only an audio tape which dealt me a glancing blow . 9 More blond thoughts . In shops and restaurants , men sometimes opened doors for me . In the dark wig , life went on as normal : at my age men ignore you . But in the blond wig , to my surprise , they behaved quite differently . One or two even wiggled their eyebrows . I 've never understood why anyone would find that sexy . A few times strangers said hello in the street and I 'd stop and stare at them and say , sorry , do I know you ? I am too long monogamous to chance upon men from some forgotten night , and I could n't remember the right response to the street come-on , which is to stick your nose in the air and stalk off . I wish I 'd had the nerve to take off the wig and see if they still tried a chat-up line , in the same way I used to wonder what blokes in the street would do if you actually gorremoff when told to do so . I did whip the wig off once during an altercation with a member of Hackney 's finest . I had to take my documents into the police station as I 'd been done for jumping some lights . The woman at the desk would n't accept a faxed insurance document . When I asked why , especially as the phone number was on it and she could have rung to check it was kosher , she replied , `` Because the people of Hackney often lie to me . '' Being a person of Hackney whose massive council tax pays her wages , that got my goat . It was a Friday , and she said I would have to come back on Monday with the correct documentation . I said I could n't because I was having chemotherapy that day . She was n't guilt-tripped by this as I had hoped she might be . She just looked at me with her eyebrows up and shrugged . She looked bored . Perhaps she thought that , like the rest of the people of Hackney , I was lying to her . In for a penny , I figured , and whipped off the wig to prove I was a chemo baldy . The eyebrows did n't lower even a fraction . I put it back on , crookedly since there was no mirror , and , huffing and puffing , left . On hot days you just ca n't keep a wig on . As the baldness continued and the summer got hotter , I liked to think I looked more like a Buddhist cult leader than a giant aged baby . On the beach in Greece there was no hiding it . Occasionally people stared - mostly through dark glasses . I stared back through mine and eventually they looked away . When it began to grow back , I got bolder , especially when a lesbian friend told me I 'd get offers . Disappointingly , I did n't . 10 Then it grew back . The new very short suede-head crop invited approaches from a different kind of stranger . One day in the local organic supermarket , I was trying to work out which soya milk to buy . -LRB- I would never have known the complexities of choice involved in going food faddy . -RRB- The piped music was a song that went `` Run baby run '' , which was vaguely familiar . `` Great music , is n't it ? '' said a bloke with a ring through his nose and topiarised hair . I nodded and smiled vaguely . `` Underground - ca n't beat it , '' he went on . I thought underground was probably a genre with which I am unfamiliar , like garage , but , not wishing to seem old and out of touch , I nodded and smiled again . `` As in Velvet , '' he added , implying that he realised I was faking . `` I knew it was Velvet Underground , '' I replied tartly . On a roll , he added : `` There 's never been a bad song about heroin . '' I assumed he was a happy heroin user who thought he 'd met a soulmate . I could see my image was confusing : part Buddhist , part monkey , part overweight astronaut . As I turned away , he said , `` Or shoplifting - there 's never been a bad song about shoplifting . '' At the time of writing , it has turned into a thick crop of curls - what 's known as the chemo curl . People pay fortunes to get their hair looking like this , I 'm told . I think I look like a used car salesman . Give me a sheepskin coat and a chunky ring with a tiny diamond in it , and I could set up along the North Circular . And if I wore a glittering , square-shouldered jacket , I 'd look like Liberace . Oh well , c'est la vie . 11 I 'd never have found out how to relax if I had n't been forced into this radical confrontation with life . I would certainly never have learned hypnosis , guided imagery and relaxation , taught to me by Jacky Owens , a wonderfully practical , clever and experienced cancer nurse . There is convincing data on how hypnotism , guided imagery and visualisation help cancer patients . They certainly help to reduce stress , and even the most hardened medics agree stress has an impact on health . I wonder now if my boob was trying to alert my brain to the fact that we had some trouble on board - which I was steadfastly refusing to attend to - when the brain got the hand to point the finger at the lump . I used to think the word relax was for wimps and sissies , that the whole point of life was to tear about on fire and burn , burn , burn . I know now that finding inner calm and stillness in the eye of the unavoidable storm that is life on earth does n't mean you are a humourless wacko living in candlelight with crystals , mandalas and plinky-plonky music ; it means you maximise your chances of getting more out of life and even perhaps living longer . 12 When I got sick , I stopped and looked so hard at my life , my eyes hurt . I had an image that summed up how I had been living leading up to the diagnosis . I was in a car driving through a desert landscape - Death Valley , perhaps - the distant desert horizons backlit by the moon against a purple and black night . Nobody was behind the wheel of the car , which was going so fast that pale silk scarves and pieces of paper were being sucked out of the open windows , but I was too exhausted to catch them . I relayed this to a therapist called John Oakley , a man who sat on a beanbag and asked me to shut my eyes and imagine what would happen if the car stopped and I got out . I went into the image and found myself as in a waking dream , getting out of the car and turning back the way I had come . I could see a tall man walking towards me in the distance . When I got close , I saw he was a skeleton . I greeted him and shook his hand , but told him firmly to go on his way and not to look back at me or follow me , and never to try to speak to me again . I told death where to go . 13 Cancer cells refuse to do as cells are supposed to and commit suicide - the medical term is apoptosis . They are wrongly named free radicals . I thought of them as neocons , which seemed apt as the continuing fallout of the war in Iraq coincided with my cancer . And while my neocons were getting blasted by some of the pharmaceutical industry 's strongest chemicals , a bunch of radical religious neocon extremists , spurred on by the architects of the neocon corporate dark arts , were busy destroying Iraq and wasting taxpayers ' billions . When I found the tumour , I turned against my ethical code and went private ; the advantage is that you do n't wait - I 'd done waiting in 1985 with a pre-cancerous cervical condition . I found the tumour on a Thursday at 3.30 am and it was out # 1,000 and a week later . But kindness and professionalism are n't predicated on money ; you find them where the people running the show are on top of things , even though resources are minimal . When clinics are badly managed , chaos prevails and patients suffer . That was my experience at Guy 's hospital , where I had chemotherapy . In the clinic at Guy 's , asking , for example , how long you might wait for your dose of chemo when you are sick and feeble - a reasonable request - means you feel like one of those nauseating prima donnas who disrupt the smooth flow of any queue , whether in a hospital or to board a plane . On the last chemo - the moment I had been counting down to for three months of hell - a nurse told me as I sat in the corridor -LRB- there was no waiting room -RRB- that my blood count was so low , I might not be able to have the chemo . This news was bleak on bleak . Anxious to get a definite yes or no , I stopped her 20 minutes later as she whizzed past , to ask when she would be able to tell me whether I 'd have it . For fear of upsetting her , I asked like a mouse , and I am no mouse . I may as well have roared , because she lost her temper . I cried , she cried , we all cried . I had been warned on a previous visit by another nurse that it was like a `` zoo '' in there sometimes . The `` zoo '' days , like this one , were crowded , chaotic and nerve-racking . There were n't even enough chairs . There were sick people standing in the corridor , waiting . The blame does n't lie with the nurses . It lies with the accountants and bean counters , government ministers and planners who fail to get priorities right . The nurses and patients bear the brunt . How can it be that Guy 's has glass-domed atriums where jazz bands play , but no waiting room and not enough chairs for cancer patients ? Our boobs are more important than their bombs . Buy a chair , pay a nurse , put the arms trade out of business . Get a life . I wrote to complain about the clinic and Guy 's chief executive , Jonathan Michael , replied . `` The service we offer is no longer adequate , '' he wrote , assuring me that improvements are in the pipeline . 14 Learning to live with cancer is like learning to live with heartbreak . At the end of an affair , for an unspecified length of time your first thought and the last before you go to sleep is of the love you lost . For months I woke up with the word cancer in my head . The time came , about seven months in , when it was n't always so . And suddenly , as I cycled across the park one bright October morning , the fear lifted , like a veil , a mist , a shroud . I revelled in a sense of happiness so intense , I do n't know how to describe it . 15 I have always thought of my friends and family as special , and they clustered and rallied around me , so that , however bad it got , I felt blessed . And the support of colleagues and students at City University , where I teach part-time , was wonderful , too . But the kindness of strangers when you feel your life is threatened was not something I 'd ever had to depend on . I have never been seriously ill before and had I not been so ill , I would not have encountered people who - there 's no more fitting metaphor - walk on water . I can conjure them up in my mind 's eye , a shimmering little crowd of them , coming up over the horizon . One was Professor Kefah Mokbel , a leading European breast cancer consultant , who removed my tumour at the Princess Grace hospital . He works nonstop , but gives patients his mobile number and does not mind being rung when something scares you half to death . Another was the nurse who works with him , Joan Travers , good-humoured and full of empathy . I also sought out complementary therapists . I saw a homeopath , a herbalist , a cranial sacral therapist and a counsellor . Call me cranky at your peril . I may not be able to quantify the positive effects of complementary therapy - there are no statistics - but I am sure that it helped enormously . At Bart 's hospital , where I ended up having radiotherapy , and now go for check-ups , the kindness and professionalism made for a calm and almost pleasurable experience , thanks to the consultant , Chris Cottrill , and to the cheerful registrars who dash about , harassed but always sympathetic , and Cheryl Inkin , who has been on reception at the clinic for many years and takes the trouble to learn patients ' names and how we are . 16 `` En el mundo del Destine , no hay statistica '' - In the world of destiny , there are no statistics -LRB- attributed to Martin Alberto Filches and quoted in Stuart Archer Cohen 's The Stone Angels -RRB- . This wonderful quotation would have meant less to me before . The minute you are diagnosed with cancer , the professionals offer up statistics to comfort you , or not , as the case may be . I was 95 % likely to be alive in 10 years after the first diagnosis , when it looked like a `` well-behaved '' cancer . After removing the tumour , it transpired that it was a grade three cancer , an aggressive one , and my survival rate went down to 90 % . The chance of a recurrence is now 5 % . These seem pretty good odds . But if you start looking at statistics , you can reconfigure them pretty much any way you like . I keep seeing articles about breast cancer with this figure of 15,000 women killed by it every year in the UK . Most of the cancer stories in the media dwell on death - death is good copy . And you find gratuitous morbidity where you least expect it : in her otherwise helpful book Your Life In Your Hands , Professor Jane Plant , who had breast cancer herself , blows it by claiming that the 63 women who followed her diet plan all remained cancer-free , but of the five who `` refused to use it or ` cheated ' ... all -LSB- have -RSB- sadly had recurrences or have died '' . Many survive without even hearing of Plant 's diet , let alone cheating on it . Someone should tell her - in the world of destiny , there are no statistics . Moreover , even as rates of breast cancer go up , deaths go down . 17 Still in el mundo statistica - one in nine women in the UK will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime , and 80 % of these are over 50 . More middle-class professional women get it . It looks as if this is because the postwar generation of middle-class girls were better fed and heavier , and so started having periods earlier . They had babies later , and fewer babies than working-class women , and when they breastfed , they did it for only a year . -LRB- Apparently having five babies and breastfeeding them for four years each helps prevent breast cancer . I can see that really catching on . -RRB- The connection seems to be the length of time for which we are exposed to high levels of oestrogen . 18 There are things you can do to ward off breast cancer : eat organic , avoid the xeno oestrogens -LRB- the bad , man-made ones -RRB- in plastics , filter your water and cut down on alcohol . There is controversy about dairy products , but some of the evidence suggests giving them up could help to ward off breast cancer . Prof Mokbel advises us to cut down on red meat and animal fats , and eat red grapes , pomegranates , cranberries , blueberries , raspberries and cherries . He advises upping fibre intake . Several hours of brisk physical activity a week reduces the danger by 30 % . Avoid HRT , drink green tea and eat soya . Work on the body mass index - obesity increases the risk for postmenopausal women by around 50 % , because after the menopause oestrogen is produced by fat cells . For a brief but comprehensive rundown on things to do to help avoid getting breast cancer , or having a recurrence , Mokbel 's advice on www.breastspecialist.co.uk is good . Suzannah Oliver 's book The Breast Cancer Prevention And Recovery Diet is helpful , and the Bristol Cancer Care helpline was , I found , the most sympathetic and well-informed . Bacup were also useful . 19 I read obituaries and always look at the dates of birth . Those of my vintage have often died `` after a long battle with cancer '' . People with cancer have enough to deal with without feeling that every day of their lives must be a battle with the disease . People with bad hearts are n't assumed to be at war with their bypasses . You do n't see `` X died after a long battle with heart disease '' - why should people with cancer be expected to take up arms ? It is better to see cancer as a journey . Everyone says that being positive helps you to come through , and being positive during a journey seems easier to me than being positive during a war in which the enemy is all around you . 20 I have three aunts who had breast cancer ; one sadly died during my treatment . If you are found to carry the faulty genes discovered in 1994 and 1995 , you have the option of taking fairly extreme measures - have your ovaries removed to prevent ovarian cancer , or a mastectomy if you have n't yet had one . In order to establish whether or not you carry the gene , you must be tested . I went to see Dr James Mackay , consultant genetic oncologist , North East Thames and University College London . In the future , if properly funded , their work could lead to major breakthroughs in breast cancer . Getting money to activate any screening at all was a struggle , but where it has got to now is theatre of the absurd : the funding stretches to screening for only 60 % of the `` sequence '' of possible genetic `` spelling mistakes '' , as Mackay calls them . If on the 60 % you are found negative , you ca n't relax because they might have found you positive on the other 40 % . Given the right breaks , research coming out of properly funded screening could work towards future preventive measures . The NHS spends only a tiny fraction of its cancer funding on prevention , surfing the waves of crisis instead . It gets more absurd - the money has been allocated for the proper screening , but so far the consultants have not been told when it will kick in at laboratory level . Hundreds of women have been promised that their 60 % will be updated to the full 100 % when the machinery is in place . But nobody seems able to say when that will be . You can get this test through a private company advertising on the internet for $ 2,900 . They test the full 100 % and results are through in three weeks . NHS tests take a year to come through - for 60 % . 21 I am free of cancer now , I hope , and wondering how this interesting journey has changed me so far . I think I 'm not as mean as I used to be , as quick to relish blame and find fault , as inclined to jump on board the mean ship schadenfreude . I 've got a life and I 'm going to keep it "
2,TRUE,"I will admit to being pro- mammogram , kind of have to , I am a mammographer , but I am not here to toot mammos horn . I am here to say that each modality has it 's limitations . One needs to do their research and choose which is best for them . Mammos use radiation and not all ca 's are seen on mammography , MRI has false positives and there is a question to what the accumulative effects of the intravenous gadolinium , some say kidney failure , Ultrasound does n't always pick up all breast ca 's either , gamma - radiation dose equivalent to about 10 mammos a year -LRB- ca n't quite remember the exact number , I actually think it is higher , Thermography can be useful in the hands of `` trained '' professionals - buyer beware , make sure you investigate who is doing your exam . That last statement actually goes for all modalities . I think the real issue in light of the recent articles of reducing screening mammos to over 50 , is it takes away a woman 's right to choose which screening modality they can choose . That in itself is wrong , every woman out there is worth the cost to be screened whichever modality they choose . "

I agree that they try to use humor to make light of the subject , but it comes at a time , that WE are so vulnerable and know that we will never make light of BC . My ladies golf group decided to host a Rally for the Cure golf event in my honor last summer . I was so hurt when one of the girls handed me a bag of boob shaped pasta that she found at some gag store . It went right into the trash when I got home . I was even offended that they saw fun in tying two pink balloons to each of the golf carts . I was probably at my most sensitive time having gone through BMX and had just lost my hair to the start of chemo . Someday I want to get up the nerve to tell them about this , but at the time , I just wanted to break down and cry . "
0,TRUE,"Tundra so sorry to hear about your BC diagnosis . It is sureal when you are first diagnosed , I remember feeling like I was in a bubble all by myself while the rest of the world just carried on around me . One step at a time , you will get further information on the cancer and what the treatment plans are . Have they made a referral to see onclogogist or surgeon , etc for you ? Bring someone who is very supportive and on the ball to your appointments . In the beginning , you may find yourself not hearing much of anything because it all seems so overwelming . You may feel numb for a while and that is the body 's way of protecting you . Once you have more answers you will start to feel better and know how to travel the road ahead of you . I started to feel better once I had an appointment with a specialist . The women here are very supportive and caring . We want to hear how you are doing and what you need . Hugs to you , and yes watch a good movie , funny is good . Someone gave me the first season of Glee which allowed for some really good laughs during a difficult time . Also let friends and family do things for you that are helpful . "

2,TRUE,"Hi everyone - I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS back in November and have since had a partial masectomy and reduction . My biopsy came back with no invasive cancer , thankfully , but I did have one margin that was not clean . I just had my re-excision which was pretty extensive but they did get it all . Now I am about to start radiation and I am wondering if anyone has had any surgery post radiation . After my re-excision , it left that breast looking somewhat disfigured and I am thinking that I might want to make that look a little better but I am hearing that healing after radiation can be very difficult . I know this might seem like a superficial question in light of what many of you are going through , but as we all know this is a very emotionally complicated thing to experience and live through and right now it is hard not to look at my breast and just think about the cancer . Any input would be appreciated "
0,TRUE,"Hi Robinlbe , Im so sorry about unclear margins . Your story sounds similar to mine , I had MRI before my lumpectomy but it did not show anything . However when I had my lumpectomy/segmental mx they found dcis clear to the lobes and scattered DCIS cells in the margin with ADH also . I ended up getting a bilateral with Tissue expanders and Its been a rough road but I feel lucky that this was found and treated so aggressively . PET scans are very expensive and I do n't think they are indicated with DCIS but I could be wrong . When you go to the oncologist ask about BRACA testing for sure . You just have to go with your gut feeling , what you can live with . . Good luck "

6,TRUE,"Hi Libby . I was in the same boat as you about a year ago . Only now am I starting to feel confident about no rads . My DCIS was also 4mm , lower grade -LRB- 1 and 2 -RRB- , no necrosis etc. . Mine was taken out with biopsy , so lumpectomy was clean . My onc said he recommends rads in 80-90 % of situations ; however mine was just not one of them . The 30 % recurrance rate without rads is across the board - women with grade 3 , larger areas , comedo and necrosis are also included in those numbers . I am on tamox ; it 's not bad . The only question I have for you is the issue with grade 3 . How did you score on the VNPI index ? Nada "

0,TRUE,"I 'm glad LML wrote the above post . I 'm afraid this post may be a bit long . I had a wire localization & lumpectomy two weeks ago & had a similar experience . I 'm no wimp , but I agree with LML that they should have started the Versed IV before the wire localization or at least given me oral valium . They used standard mammography to guide the wire , except that I was allowed to sit , instead of standing like you do with screening mammograms . The first problem was that the initial two tries at compressing my breast , enough to get a good picture of my very deep DCIS , were so painful , I thought they were going to crack my breastbone & I was bruised for over a week after . Then , they finally got me in a tolerable compression & the needle for the local anesthetic caused just a teensy pinch , but they had to insert two wires to `` bracket '' the depth of the cancerous area & I do n't think they gave me enough local anesthetic . So , like LML , I felt the end of the 2nd wire at the end of the insertion , with referred pain right to my nipple . Then , I felt myself start to black out , so I warned my team that I was going to faint , then I did faint . I came to with 4 women , including the radiologist , wiping me down with cold , damp cloths & apologizing . Then I threw up -- bile , of course , because naturally I had n't eaten anything , as instructed , in about 12 hours . Trust me , I 'm not a wuss . I really was all right finally , after throwing up , but I think those first two excruciating breast compressions really started me down the road by causing me so much pain , then having to have 2 wires without really enough local anethestic or something beforehand just finished me off . Sorry to scare anybody who 's going for this , but maybe you can make sure that you get what you need beforehand so you do n't have this experience . Thank heaven , the lumpectomy itself went very well . But , how long has anyone else has soreness or sensitivity after their lumpectomy ? The surgeon took out more of a slab than a lump & I 'm still fairly sore two weeks out . Ice helps hugely . But my nipple has become hypersensitive & nothing much really helps that . Any suggestions ? "

It is normal to worry when active treatments end but I 've decided to take the attitude that I 'll handle things that happen down the road if I need to . I do n't want to waste the next years worrying about ` what if '' . I 've also been amazed by the stage IV ladies on these boards that keep positive - they are an inspiration to me .

2,TRUE,"This is an interesting thread , especially in light of the recent revelation that the number of bilateral mastectomies has increased dramatically over the last years with women with a first episode of breast cancer , prophylactically removing the remaining breast . Here is Reuters-derived ASCO news on this : `` The new study involved an analysis of data for 152,755 women who were diagnosed with cancer in one breast between 1998 and 2003 and entered in the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results -LRB- SEER -RRB- , the US National Cancer Institutes ' database . Overall , 4,969 patients elected to undergo preventative mastectomy in the other breast . The rates of the operation were 3.3 percent among women who had any surgery , including those who underwent single mastectomy or only had their tumor removed , and 7.7 percent among mastectomy patients . The overall rate of double mastectomy - that included removal of an unaffected breast climbed from 1.8 percent in 1998 to 4.5 percent in 2003 , the report indicates . Among mastectomy patients , the rate rose from 4.2 percent to 11.0 percent . These trends were noted for patients at any cancer stage and were still apparent at the end of the study period . Characteristics of the women who underwent double mastectomy included younger patient age , non-Hispanic white race , lobular breast cancer type , and a prior cancer diagnosis , the researchers found . Large tumor size was associated with an increase in the overall rate of the procedure , but with a decrease in the rate among mastectomy patients . `` The main unanswered question from this research is : why are more women choosing to undergo double mastectomy ? '' Tuttle said . I had a contra-lateral prophylactic mastectomy -LRB- CPM -RRB- . I did it because of the medical difficulty in establishing my first breast cancer , the same scenario of lumpy , dense breasts on the opposite side , and mainly because I wanted to lower statistically my risk of contra-lateral breast cancer to as low as possible . Years later -LRB- delayed because of illness -RRB- I had reconstruction surgery . A primary mastectomy , one done because of one 's first cancer , equates in overall survival to lumpectomy and radiation , not to lumpectomy alone . Take away the radiation , and the recurrence rate is less effective with just lumpectomy . Needing radiation adds fodder to one 's decision making . So does the idea that recurrence in the lumpectomy and irradiated breast does occur . How does one feel about that ? Does it pose a source of too frequent anxiety ? Will a second round of chemotherapy treatment be needed if a node then gets involved with recurrence ? These are questions a woman must ask herself . Similarly much thought must be given to how one feels about a mastectomy . Will you be o.k. with it ? Do you mind prosthesis wearing ? Do you wish reconstruction or are you fine without it ? The local recurrence rate post mastectomy is low , as it is the ultimate surgery to remove breast tissue . But recurrence does occur . What is sad is the lack of a crystal ball . Breast cancer knowledge is changing , but it always will be the Beast . Post mastectomy radiation adds another layer of complexity to this issue of mastectomy . Solid evidence supports it 's use if 4 or more nodes are positive and it widely recommended . No randomized , prospective study has been concluded to show the effects in 1 to 3 nodes . Yet many well done retrospective analysis suggest that radiation kills breast cancer cells , which we know can linger in the breast in spite of chemotherapy . Killing those cancer cells may just prevent them from subsequently seeding elsewhere in the body or re-emerging locally in the breast which can be hard to handle medically and cosmetically . We may never fully know the answer for the 1-3 node + women in this regard . To have or not to have a mastectomy , either on the primary side or contra-lateral prophylactic side is much more than a cosmetic decision , imo . Many variables interplay , some of them drawn on through viewing one 's present findings , some drawn on by re-viewing future statistical chance . When that future number becomes you , it 's 100 % . Some people are relatively easy on themselves and do n't look back too hard , others not so and therefore try to lower the look-back risk to avoid it 's emotional turmoil . It is a hugely personal decision with so many complexities that no one can judge but the patient . I know the goal is to move us to less invasive procedures . Yet I wonder how the medical community squares this with the fact that once in the throes of breast cancer , many women opt to remove the other breast too . Is it something to do with the toxicity of current treatment , the incredible emotional impact having breast cancer has , the knowledge that breast tissue grows cancers , even in seemingly health sides , or that hormones , really anti-hormones are not without their negative effects that moves women to this drastic decision ? Is it too , that they tire of the `` medicalness '' of chronic monitoring , chronic doctoring , chronic considering which pushes some to have at it and be done with it -LRB- even knowing you 're never , ever really done -RRB- ? Many issues , many thoughts . It 's truly your decision my sisters , and there 's not a right or a wrong here . Carpedeim , I 'm sorry you have just received a diagnosis of breast cancer , and I welcome you to the breastcancer.org discussion board . Please let us know how you do with your chemotherapy and other treatments should you wish . Someone 's here almost all the time , and all have much personal experience with breast cancer .

6,TRUE,Keep in mind that my saline experience was from the TE but I would say there is a definate difference between the two . The silicone implant feel very much like real flesh and I was always aware of the saline . . Sorry this happened to you . .

Unfortunately staph has this nasty habit of reappearing if it has not completely left the body and I would hate for you to be in the same boat in a few months replacing another implant . .

0,TRUE,"after reading all the post here I wanted to say that I was treated with radioactive iodine 2 different times in 1990 for Graves disease . Since then a couple years ago I developed a kidney stone found out it was caused from a bad parathyroid gland and had it have it removed and was told the RAI could have caused this and then in 2007 , shortly there after came up with breast cancer and once again have read that the RAI may have caused that also . I am on synthroid now and have been on it for at least 17 years now . Thyroid was holding good on meds until my radiation for breast cancer -LRB- hmmmm -RRB- and then it went hypo again so I would say it was zapped in the radiation treatment . Synthroid has been upped two times since all this started . I honestly believe there is a link between the radioactive iodine and breast cancer .

Dove was one of the brands of body wash that my rads team said I could use while I was going through treatment . I did use corn starch also durning my treatments . I put it in a old spice jar with big holes . I found that was what worked best for me . Good luck to all who are just starting out with rads .
6,TRUE,"Kay , that sucks to get such news . I was in a similar boat three years ago when I was dx with my mets . I was 8 years since my orginal dx with they discovered mets to my sternum .

Today , I noticed that he looked nervous when we were talking to the oncologist . He seems to be really concerned chemo and its duration . God , cancer is tough . "
0,TRUE,"Hi Susan - I 'm sorry to hear of your diagnosis ... sounds like youve had a long road . The oncologist still thinks radiation is an option after chemo , however my surgeon would prefer operating , as its a `` safer '' bet . Less risks than radiation -LRB- will radiation work , the dangers of it killing other `` good '' cells in my body and not just the bad ones , etc -RRB- ... however they did say the chemo could shrink the small part of the cancer that is left in me , and they could find nothing -LRB- I 'm hopeful for this -RRB- once they do go back in . Personally I agree with the surgeon , as I would rather have them operate after chemo than chance anything with radiation . I feel that the doctors do know whats best for each patient , and maybe you have been highly responsive to radiation in the past . This is my first go with everything and I want to do the most radical , agressive actions possible to lessen my risk of it coming back . Lets do please keep in touch . Give that daughter of yours a hug !! I know my daughter is a huge source of strength for me , I am so thankful for all of my family in these trying times . "
2,TRUE,"Marg ~ As difficult as it is to believe it now , your life will be fine after you 're finished with your treatment . It sounds like you are very recently dx 'd , and , yes , it 's a long haul -- maybe as much as a year or more , depending on the tx you need . But it does end , and your scars lessen and your hair grows back -LRB- if you 've had chemo -RRB- , and rads come to an end , if you have to have those , and eventually you 're living your life again . Breast cancer does change you , but from someone who 's been through it in the past 2 years , as hard as it is to understand now , there can be hidden blessings in this journey , like learning to put yourself first , and realizing how much people really love you .

6,TRUE,"I was in the same boat , but because of family hx and positive lymphnodes and age , i am choosing to do the 4 TC treatments . There are some very helpful posts on these boards especially tips for getting through chemo . even the naturopathic oncologist told me to do the chemo and i am loaded with supplements to help ease the effects . The best advice is drinking LOTS of water and using alpha lipoic acid -LRB- to help prevent neuropathy -RRB- so many tips on these boards just read read read . Also one pointer that was given to me is that I have a solid job now and insurance to cover . would hate to pass up chemo and then suddenly be one of the many losing their jobs in the future and have no coverage . Its important that the choice be yours . Ive had alot of people who have never had cancer try to tell me what to do from the start but it has to be your choice and really the advice i have received from these boards is priceless . best wishes "
6,TRUE,"Ladies , I have sat here and read all posts on this thread with a heavy heart . I do understand what Agentmo was getting at but I also understand what the other ladies have said . I was Dx 'd originally stage IIb no nodes involved and was pretty much assured that I would be a-okay as far as recurrance was concerned but here I now sit , stage IV and my doc is still shaking his head and saying I have defied statistics . This is the truth of BC . Anyone at anytime can be in the same boat as I am , so , node involvement or no node involvement is a mute point we are all fighting for our lives . IMHO stage definately does not matter ! "
5,TRUE,"Last week I was posting on the `` worried . . '' board and now already we are in the IDC board . BC can be a fast moving train obviously . I really appreciate the support here and will try to ask specific questions and save the venting for later . Based on the pathology report and exam , our breast surgeon thinks my wife is stage II , maybe stage III with 3 tumors and at least 5 lymph nodes . He says must do mastectomy since it is `` multicentric carcinoma '' . Did not recommend a BM but left it up to us -LRB- he ordered a MRI on the other side to maybe help us decide but also was worried that if the MRI picks up something it would delay surgery on the cancerous breast . -RRB- My main issue is how can we make an iformed decision without a PET/CT or something to see if it has spread outside the breast ? That seems important to me . If it has not spread outside -LRB- not detectable anyway -RRB- that would make me more positive going into surgery . And god forbid if it has spread and is bad -LRB- have n't got any good news yet -RRB- maybe that would impact my wifes decision . She is worried that is has spread past the breast and I ca n't see her going through surgery then getting more bad news at a PET/CT scan . Of course the surgeon wants her decision on BM soon but I think more info is needed . Thanks for any info . "
6,TRUE,I was in the same boat as you . My tumor markers jumped about 25 points . My onc thinks that they were drawn to close to the finishing up of my AC treatment and I had an infection brewing that I did n't know about at the time at my mastectomy site . I have n't had them drawn since then and I 've decided that I do n't want to know what they are in the future . the values drive me too crazy ! TIna
6,TRUE,"I guess we are all in the same boat with one issue or another . Yesterday went to PT for the first time due to `` cording '' in the lymph node area . The physical therapist looked at my arm and said `` What 's that ? '' I have a blue mark on the inside of my arm near the armpit that showed up after the surgery , looks like the blue dye from the sentinel node injection , and some lumps under that mark . The physical therapist said she has n't ever seen this before . She called in another therapist that does lymphedema and that therapist had not seen this before ... so before they touch the arm I have to go back to the surgeon -LRB- # 4 since surg on 3/10 -RRB- and have her examine that area and give clearance so they can start therapy . Also because of the bleed now have anemia ... home on a 3 day medical leave to just get things together . I have cancelled the radiation until I get my body back in shape . Appt with oncologist next week to review rads ... not sure I will ever get that done . My lesion was only 0.3 cm ... so tiny and 3 sent . nodes all clear . I am estrogen progesterone positive and that 's it !!! Any opinions on bypassing rads ? Has anyone done that ? "
0,TRUE,"Hmmm , this gives you pause , does n't it , Flalady . I 'm glad to see you had a followup , yet it does sound a tad confusing . And to wait so long at the appointment , which is n't so unusual when you see the top doctor , is hard on top of taking in the words and making sense of them in a complicated situation . So , now is it you wait for a while until a third scan is done down the road to break the tie , so to speak ? I 'm wondering if interventional radiology might be able to deliver a pellet chemotherapy , as a way to deal with your findings , should it be technically feasible at some point . I know your surgeon thought maybe cyberknife at some point too . I 'm sure you 'll keep on with your current personal regimen . I 'm hoping in a bit some clearer direction may come your way as to recommendations . Surely some triple negative breast expert might have experience with slow growth situations . I 'm glad to see you post . I 've been wondering how you are . Thanks for the update . I 'll be thinking on this and you . Tender "

4,TRUE,"So sorry to hear your disappointing news -LRB- especially on New Years Eve -RRB- . Sounds like some of the chemo has worked and part of this roller coaster ride is finding the right combo to eat up those cancer-sucker cells . If the herceptin really is n't making a difference , you could possibly try tykerb . Are you also taking a bisphosphonate for bone health ?? Sometimes that can even help with really small bone spots by encapsulating them . Best of luck with you surgeon 's appointment . Hopefully it will be nothing . I 'll be sending gentle hugs and best thoughts . "
6,TRUE,"I 'm curious ... What did you and your oncologist decide to do ? I 'm in the same boat , except that I 'm two years older at 34 . I 'm about to get married and want to have children .

4,TRUE,"Hi again Beergirl - after my mastectomy they said my tumor was 0.9 cm - but like you , the MRI showed it to be 1.7 cm . I also had DCIS surrounding it which makes me happy that I got the mastectomy . As for the results on my Oncotype DX - this is a special test requested by my oncologist through a company in California . It 's very expensive -LRB- about $ 4,000 -RRB- but I was told my insurance company would pay for it . So you wo n't find that information on your original pathology report . However , your original pathology report SHOULD say something about the ER , PR and HERneu results ... my Herneu results were inconclusive - that 's why it was sent out for a FISH test . If you do n't get any answers from your surgeon , go back to the doctor who did the very first biopsy of your tumor -LRB- mine was a radiologist who did a needle-aspiration -RRB- .

Yesterday I was supposed to start rads but got stuck in chemo getting my 3 week dose of herceptin.I thought that I had a reaction 3 weeks ago so they gave me benedryl and zantac before the infusion . Anyway , I ended up with reaction anyway and they had to give me more drugs to counteract . I was there for 6 hours while they slowly dripped it . I am afraid the Dr. is going to make me have the herceptin once a week instead of every 3 weeks . Bummer but if that is what it takes then I will do it . I have my appointment with rads tomorrow . I have been reading all of the posts from the past week or so and hope that everyone is feeling better , Bold : Kudos on making it through ! Tx 6 was hardest for me but by week 2ξ1/2 you will feel better . My advice to all is to plan something fun between tx # 4 and # 5 and that will get you through til the end .

0,TRUE,"Thanks for all the info . I do hope it will go well . I do have a problem . I have been trying to pin down my surgeon regarding the sentinel node biopsy . He said it was not necessary for my procedure . I have been pressing him via email for an answer as to why it is not necessary . I asked him how we would know if perhaps a malignant cell might have escaped and gone into the nodes . He said `` then do the sentinel if you have those concerns . '' He wo n't tell me if he feels that the odds of a node being positive is very , very rare with LCIS . Then I could easily make a decision as I use my arms and hands as an artist/sculptor and ca n't compromise their strength . . From what I can gather , the surgeon will not respond to my question because doctors are very worried about being sued , and if a direct question is asked , and I follow his opinion , and then there I get invasive cancer down the road , he worries about getting sued . My husband practiced medicine , and was required to take `` Risk Management '' courses every year to renew his malpractice insurance . Part of this involves how to talk to patients so you do n't open yourself u to a law suit . So this is really a bummer because I am unable to make an informed decision . My surgeon is one of the best surgeons in NY . He did an amazing job on my excisional biopsy . It looks almost exactly as it did and so I do want him to be part of my surgical team . Does anyone have any info on the necessity of SNB for someone who has LSIC -LRB- lobular carcinoma in situ -RRB- NOT DCIS ? Any good papers on the necessity for it with LCIS ?

0,TRUE,"Honey , I am a Triple Neg and 9 years post treatment and just fine . The GOOD news about Triple Negs is that if we get through the first couple of years our chances of recurrence are almost nothing . They drop off the chart . While the other types diminish at an orderly rate . There are thousands of women out here who have had this challenge , been so scared and marched on and are just fine . I met a lady at the dog park who had her BC in 1985 and told me she often forgets which side it was on . When I told my bible study group about 25 women , 3 of them were survivors . One was 22 years out from a double mast , one was 17 years and one 11years out . All of them are still just fine . What you need to know is that the vast majority of us will recover and be just fine . When you are on the net and even on this site , it looks like nothing but bad news . But truly , all the women I started with are long past posting , living their lives , and BC is fading as just another bump in the road . I am so sorry to hear about your husband . So tragic . I am a life long panic attack/depressive/anxiety attack , and I know that the suffering is horrible , and if that was where he was , God bless his soul . Keep posting , we have wonderful women here who can help you with the whole journey . This is really not a lot different from getting the news you are diabetic or have heart disease , just for some reason it scares us all silly . You are not alone , you are a sister , you are welcomed and cherished on this board . We will do all we can to make this journey doable and sometimes even a little humor pops up . So if you need to , ask your doc for Ativan , or Xanax , and just take one when you wake up in the morning you are going for an appt . or a treatment . If you have severe problems , consider anti-depressives , they are truly a miracle . We truly care about you and your family . So feel at home and post any old time . Gentle hugs , Shirlann "
5,TRUE,We watched cals in my right breast for several years but I was diagnosed in the LEFT side . So -- do n't buy the worry train till you have to purchase the ticket .
0,TRUE,I also opted for a bi-lateral mastectomy after diagnosis of bc in one breast . After my surgery my good breast also showed ALH and probably would have cooked up the same thing down the road . I chose to remove them both because it was so darn hard to find the breast cancer the first time . I had very dense breasts and did not trust imaging . It is funny because I still do not know if the thickened area was the breast cancer or if the breast cancer was hiding under the fibrocystic dense breast tissue . I had the thickened area for two years and had mammos and ultrasounds which showed nothing as well as breast surgeons who said it was fibrocystic dense breast tissue . My thickened area was also in the upper outer quadrant and was a much larger area than the size of my tumor . My tumor was deep -LRB- just 2 mm from the chest wall -RRB- so who knows what the thickened area was . All I can say is know your breasts well and check out anything that seems unusual . Because you have atypical cells you are at an increased risk . If I could do it over again I probably would have taken Tamoxifen when diagnosied with ALH and definately would have regular MRI 's and ultrasounds in addition to mammograms .
0,FALSE,"Hi , Deen ~ I also experienced a change in vision immediately after chemo , which would have been back in October Things just were n't as sharp , and I would not even drive at night for several weeks because I felt my vision was impaired .

Recovery was o.k. , just first couple days needed some pain meds . Do n't blame you for not wanting another surgery , though .

0,TRUE,"revkat - This is a good topic and thanks for bringing it up . I will be facing this decision down the road . Right now I 'm in the middle of my 2nd round of chemo -LRB- CMF -RRB- , then I get rads , then tamoxifen . I 'm nearing 53 and pre-menopausal . lewing - I also had quite a long period after round 1 of chemo ended . -LRB- I 'm hoping that one of the benefits of chemo is chemopause . -RRB- I should be finished with chemo and rads toward the end of the year and I thought I would get 5 years of tamoxifen . At one of my last visits with my oncologist , however , she mentioned that we may switch to an AI after two years or so , but she left it open . I 'm not sure what testing would be done to make a decision . darCraig - I hope the AI SE 's get better !! "

5,TRUE,"Carollyn - no time is a good time to get a dx of BC ... . but having gone through two house reconstructions , I certainly understand what you 're up against ! It feels like you have to stop the train of your life , and get off on a stop that you really did n't plan on - at a village you do NOT want to visit , not even for one night , never mind months or years ... and you look over your shoulder and the train moves on without you . That 's how I felt when I got the phone call at work ... . but that image disappeared quickly when all the teachers where I work rallied to support me -LRB- so many with their own BC stories -RRB- . Somehow Carollyn you 'll work out the details - the reconstruction of your health will be tougher than reconstructing your house ... . but with the help of family and friends you 'll do it .

0,TRUE,"Hi Laura ... I have only been on this site a month or so and it has been incredibly helpful to me . Like you , I do n't have any friends that have been down this BC road , and there is just no way someone can truly understand if they have not experienced it firsthand . Here in my area the only reconstruction options were TE/implants and TRAM . I was not happy with either of those for various reasons . The TRAM did not appeal to me because of the abdominal muscle loss , and because it was going to be a 12 hour surgery here -LRB- because they do about 1 a month here vs other surgeons that do a few a week -RRB- . I 'd read about the DIEP -LRB- none of my Drs here even mentioned it !! -RRB- but because I 'd have to travel it seemed not to be an option . But the women on this board made it very clear that traveling for DIEP was not only doable , but well worth it if that is the surgery you feel is right for you . I think it is probably only because of this board and other 's sharing their DIEP experiences that I decided to look into it seriously . I traveled to MD and NY -LRB- from VA -RRB- to meet with two different surgeons and decided to have my surgery in NY . For me , I know this is the right surgery . It is another one of those huge decisions , which seem to just keep coming in this BC journey . I do understand and wish you luck with the process . ~ Suzanne "
4,TRUE,"Marissa , I 'm sorry that you had to join this club . This is a great place to ask questions , get information and just vent ! I did get a second opinion but that was because my first surgeon did n't get clear margins after 2 biopsies and gave me my options without really knowing what was there . I got a second opinion with a wonderful surgeon who found out what was there and has supported me through the whole decision-making process . I handled bc in different ways . I researched and researched and got a lot of information . That made me feel calmer and more in control of what was happening and the decisions I needed to make . I also prayed and when I could n't pray , I had a lot of friends who were praying for me . There were times I just could n't pray about it because my feelings were all over the place and overwhelming . Also , like was mentioned before , if someone wants to do something for you like making meals , run errands , clean the house , etc. , let them do it . It 's one less thing on your mind to think about AND it makes them feel like they are helping you . I had a few friends tell me that they felt helpless and did n't know what else to do for me . They gave me 4 weeks of meals after my Bilateral Mastectomy . It was wonderful and gave me time to recooperate and catch up on things that were put aside during my recovery time . It 's a rollercoaster ride but you will get through this . :-RRB- The wonderful ladies here and I will help you all that we can . Hugs ! "
4,FALSE,"I have been reading the boards since dx in September ' 08 , but just now got internet at home , so can finally reply . Love the funny stories , and can really relate to the `` farting '' stories . I have a recent funny one of my own . After work , I traveled 45 minutes to go watch my 15 y/o daughter Michelle 's high school basketball game . I was wiped out , and knew I would still have to drive home , so was ready to leave immediately after the game . My daughter wanted to stay and watch the boy 's game , which followed hers . I told her she could , if she could find a ride home . She was able to hook up with a friend on the team , and so I left , knowing she was taken care of . I have been sleeping poorly because of night sweats , leg cramps , etc. , and the last night I only had 4 hours of sleep . When I got home from the game , I took a sleeping pill , because I ca n't afford to have two sleepless nights , and still go to work the next day . When I was driving my 13 y/o son to school the next morning , he asked why I let him go get Michelle . I said , confused , `` What are you talking about ? '' He said `` You let me go get Michelle at the school . '' I said again , `` What are you talking about ? '' He explained that Michelle had called last night and said she needed a ride home from school . I woke you up , and you said `` Just go get her . '' I said to my son , horrified , `` No I did n't . '' He said `` You did too ! '' `` But I was n't awake ! '' I cried . My 13 year old son drove to the school at 10:30 at night to pick up his sister ! She was so stunned , she did n't know what to do . She did n't have a driver 's license either , so she let him drive home .

2,TRUE,"Hello , Just checking in on the CMF girls . Remember , you will get through this !! I agree with Cheryl .

4,FALSE,"Angie - I 've skipped over some of these posts , so somebody may have already gotten back to you on this : I 'm also on A/C . I take the 1st of the 3 Emend -LRB- the 125mg tab -RRB- on tx day , an hour before tx . I also apply the cream -LRB- Emla or generic -RRB- an hour before tx ; apply liberally & cover with saran wrap . I had a port inserted during my lumpectomy , & I 'm so glad that I did . They draw the bloodwork thru it on tx day , plus give my the pre-tx meds & then the tx 's thru it . The pre-meds they gave me on tx day were Decadron -LRB- steroid -RRB- , Aloxi -LRB- anti-nausea -RRB- , & Ativan -LRB- anti-nausea + anti-anxiety -RRB- . -LRB- Next tx , I 'm going to try w/o the Ativan ; I was exceptionally sleepy the entire day last time , & my onc said I could try w/o it or w/half dose . -RRB- On days 2 & 3 , I 'm to take Emend -LRB- 80mg -RRB- & Decadron -LRB- 8mg -RRB- in the morning ; day 4 continue with 8mg of Decadron in the morning . -LRB- I 'm going to try splittin the 4th day 's dose of Decadron into 1/2 dose on day 4 & 1/2 dose on day 5 , to lessen the post-steroid crash that I had this time , with my onc 's ok . -RRB- I also have prescriptions for Ativan as well as Compazine for use throughout the cycle , as needed - either one or the other as often as every 6 hrs . Either Ativan or Compazine may be taken together with -LRB- or overlapping -RRB- the Emend & Decadron , but the Ativan & Compazine should not be taken together or have their doses overlap . My onc told me to get Miralax , & they suggested I take a dose on tx day as a precaution -LRB- to avoid constipation -RRB- . I did n't take one that day because I had no problems in that area , let 's just say . I did take a dose of it the morning of days 2 & 3 , but have n't needed to take it since , as nature has been moving things along . -LRB- I also have Immodium on hand but have n't needed that either . -RRB- The Compazine does n't seem to be terribly constipating , at least not at the level I was taking it . I took Zofran to combat nausea from the pain meds I had after surgery , & that -LRB- plus the pain meds -RRB- was much more constipating for me . But each person is different . -LRB- A friend of mine who 's an onc nurse actually recommends using stool softeners rather than laxatives , but I went with my onc 's recommendation . Either w/b ok , though . -RRB- I took one Ativan before bed on tx day -LRB- post-tx , just to make sure I slept -RRB- , & have n't taken any since . I took one Compazine each morning on days 2 thru 6 , did n't take any more at any other time on those days , & have n't taken any since - and I 'm now on day 10 . The other thing I 'm doing , at the suggestion of alot of posters on the boards here , plus on the advice of a friend who 's an onc nurse , is taking a Pepcid Complete each morning . -LRB- You can take up to 2 of those every 24 hrs . -RRB- Yesterday I forgot to take it , had some indigestion , but nothing horrible , then remembered the Pepcid . I 've been eating whatever I feel like , whenever I feel like it - most of the time the same kinds of foods that I 'd been eating pre-chemo . A few days -LRB- for me , days 5 & 6 -RRB- I had less of an appetite & ate lighter , easier foods . Chicken soup is great , also crackers or toast , & noodle-based dishes without too much sauce or spices . I 've got 8 containers -LRB- at least a pint each -RRB- of home-cooked chicken soup in the freezer now , courtesy of a very good friend of mine . General advice re : meals - Eat smaller portions , more frequently . It 's often easier to get through a small meal or a snack , not only physically by psychologically . And once you start having more successful eating endeavors , it 'll get even easier . One general bit of advice : When people offer to help , LET THEM ! Different people can help in different ways & at different times . My soup-cooker friend happens to be a good cook & is used to cooking in large quantities , plus she 's my closest friend , so I had no trouble asking her to do this . I have other cooking-offers on hold -LRB- for when I 'll need them -RRB- , & have been spreading out the rides I ask for among several people . It really does make people feel good to help , & you 'll feel better , too ! Hope things go well for you ! "

The perspective of time and experience living with things the way they are will help you make up your mind .

Today , not doing it in specific cases , is more than justified . As one of the `` side-effects '' -LRB- if you can call it that -RRB- of chemo is leukemia , it becomes a weighty decision when the onco dx is low and the doctors are still waving their chemo pom-poms at you . My dx is ILC , which is a sneaky monkey in that it 's possible to have a hidden patch 4cm away from the lumpectomy site with `` technically '' clear margins , as opposed to you-betcha clean margins .

I did not go the next day so took what I thought was a stool softener , I went , but had a little trouble , so took more stool softener , which was actually a laxative ! So you all know what happened next !!! But I do know the chemo made my mouth taste horrid , very few foods appealed to me.Not sure if I was tired from the chemo or the self induced diarrhea.And when I had my herceptin last week , I had blurred vision , is this normal ? Doctor did not think it was from herceptin , but think I read on here where someone else had that problem ? So very very glad you all are here sharing . Jackie "
0,TRUE,"Because I am triple neg , I had little choice . My BS and my oncologist informed me that the only way to go was as agressive as possible , which I did . I was diagnosed with 1.2 cm IDC , Stage 1 , Grade 3 , no nodes . I had 4 DD Adriamycin , 1 DD Taxol -LRB- neuropathy right out of the gate -RRB- and then switched to 3 DD of Taxotere , and am halfway through my 33 rounds of rads . I am 62 , a widow , work full time , missed very few days through the chemo , and raise my 14 year old grand-daughter . It was a bit more than a `` bump in the road '' as they all like to tell us , but in retrospect , I am glad I gave it all I could . Once my rads end - geez , I 've got nothing but prayer ! Good luck to us all . "
2,TRUE,"I am at the light at the end of the tunnel . I am ending my reconstruction phase with the tissue expanders . These uncomfortable alien-like things I have in my body obviously do not feel real . I am concerned about my size . Before BC I was a full B. I had no intention to go much bigger than that but my skin has been stretched as much as it can go . I am at 630cc , which seems like alot but when I look at them the expanders look alot smaller than that . I asked a friend of mine who just went through the same ordeal as I did but was about 1 month ahead of me what size her permanent silicone implants were and she said 450cc . He breasts are a full C and look nice . I 'm just really confused on how big mine will really look since they appear so small now . If they are like my friends and I stay at 630cc I will look like Doly Parton ? I 'm so confused ... "
4,TRUE,"My onc practice became involved in that trial this summer . They 're offering it women who 've already done Xeloda and Tykerb . I believe it might be in Phase 3 now , I 'd have to check on it . It definitely has fewer side effects then chemo . It 's supposed to give Herceptin a boost when it stops working so you can get a longer ride on it . "
0,TRUE,"I have been on the Arimidex since May of 2010 ... noticed hair loss about August or September of 2010 ... I 'm using Nioxin with some new growth noted but it seems as fast as I get stubbles , the hair loss is expanding . It started in the middle of the top of my head and is now spreading towards the front . Oncologist said she is not sure whether or not it will come back , although it is , slowly , with the Nioxin . I feel like discontinuing it . I have more than four years left on this crap and really do n't want to be bald for that time . It was one thing to lose my hair during chemo but at least that was somewhat time limited . I 'm just disgusted . Do n't feel like I dare discontinue it as I do n't want to kick myself in the ass 8 years down the road if I hear of more cancer . Also hate to lose my hair if it 's coming back anyway . It sounds petty in the big scheme of things but I 'm just really down about it . "
6,TRUE,"I am also in this boat . I am easily angered and easily set off to cry . I rushed thru surgery , chemo and now on tamoxefen . Lymphadema on surgery side which is constantly aching and swelling . I feel like I have been shorted and I still do n't understand the path report . I have major mind farts . I ca n't say a simple sentence without forgetting the word or not getting it out . Everyone at home thinks that because chemo and reconstruction is thru that I should be A-OK . I do n't feel A-0K .

6,TRUE,"Rose - I 'm sort of in the same boat . I am just finishing rads , about 18 more to go . I had lumpectomy , 10 nodes removed , chemo and now rads . I am 54 , and have had 2 periods in the last year so my Onc considers me perimenopausal . As I have a non symptomatic blood condition with clotting , we are worried about Tamoxifen . I 'm not sure I want to take it anyway , might prefer a more nutritional approach to reduce estrogens . She also thought I should remove my ovaries and then do Arimidex . As I am quite sure I am in or aproaching full blown menopause , I keep asking if they can test my estrogen blood levels . She says they can NOT as they are always shifting during the cycle . I am very frustrated , thinking they may test low , indicating menopause . But she says they could be up the next week and we would n't know . There is lots of good information on the `` natural girls '' thread about DIM and other natural ways to reduce estrogen . Some of those ladies might know about combining it with Arimidex . "
6,TRUE,Oh that is just great . I hope to be in the same boat soon !! I finish chemo tomorrow then on to Femara and Herceptin . CONGRATS !!!!
5,TRUE,"So sorry you are having such an awful time . I had 4 AC and 4 T three weeks apart and it was very manageable . I was lucky in that respect . Maybe an adjustment in the dosage and timing of the chemo will work better for you . I have DCIS , IDC , ILC and IBC , 6 cm tumor , grade 3 , Stage IIIb . The chemo worked . The tumor has all but disappeared . I 'm scheduled for surgery next Monday to be followed by radiation . Taxol gave me pain in my back , legs and feet and tingling in my fingers . However , that 's almost gone now and my final treatment was less than 3 weeks ago . I hope and pray things begin to get better for you on the chemo train . "
2,TRUE,"for me , learning to listen to my gut , which sometimes overrules my head , is what helps me make those tough decisions . I had to go all the way to making the appointment for -LRB- reconstruction -RRB- surgery to hear my gut yelling `` no , do n't want to do this '' . so I cancelled the appointment , and waited 8 months to have a different surgery with a different doc in a different hospital . this time , I had the green light , and it was the right choice . best in making this difficult decision ... p / "
0,TRUE,"Keepingthefaith , I 'm so sorry it was such an uncomfortable experience for you . I see that you are newly-diagnosed , so there will be a lot of things that you 'll have to grow more comfortable with . In my experience , EVERYONE has wanted to see my breasts , from the PS -LRB- of course -RRB- , to the oncologist , and even the radiation oncologist . Boy , does one learn to get over the whole modesty thing quickly . -LRB- But I still prefer the gown ... LOL -RRB- My oncologist gives me a clinical breast exam every time I see him , and I see him three times a year . That running the fingers down the breast is a technique that even my BS uses -LRB- and she 's female -RRB- . In the beginning , my husband went to my appts with me , and he was always in the room when the various doctors examined me . No issues there . And when I had drains , he 'd help unpin and pin . Lastly , I just wanted to say , it 's reassuring to me to be examined so closely so many times a year . Both my BS , who I see twice a year , and my oncologist , give me very thorough exams , feeling my neck , armpits , etc. . It 's a good feeling to be watched so closely . Good luck to you on your journey . It is not an easy road . Take care . "
0,TRUE,"Thank you so much for responding Beesie . On a day when I really needed an honest opinion , not just say things to make me feel better , I really needed to hear from you .

Watched my mom die , slowly of BC . I am 43 . But with closer surveillence dont we have a better chance than the average women ? Cus they are watching for it ? Im glad you feel like you do , and I PRAY I can get there . Only child , no kids , dont want to fret to my husband and make us both nuts . Helps to be on here but sometimes , it can make me worry more . I am ER+PR + . Tamox benifits dont outweight the benefits for me . the isert on the meds even says so for DCIS patients . BS doesnt pressure me , he knows im not taking it . I just keep thinking these dang negative thoughts . Somehow I relate everything to it . Like how many more Xmas am I gon na b here . I know like I said , we are lucky , it is GONE , no follow up , we caught it in time etc , in my head i think its worse than it is ??? Im crazy .

0,TRUE,"Sand - I do n't really have much advice for you because I was only able to take one A/C tx . But I feel for you and understand what you 're going through . TMarina is right - have a good cry , get mad , hit something ! I could never have imagined how rough the road through treatment would be . I think my husband is getting tired of me saying , `` I just want to be me again . '' But it 's true . I 'd give anything to be the old Sherry again . And yet , I have to make it through another day with no hair , an itchy wig , knees and a hip that are in constant pain , ca n't sleep , extreme fatigue and ultra white skin ! ! ! .

0,TRUE,"Okay I am going to ask all of you ladies out there a question , not Tamoxifen related . I had 2 lumpectomies and when all said and done they removed over 18 cm of breast tissue . With that much taken out I am completely lopsided . I went from having a full C-cup to and A-cup . 1st surgery in Jan and 2nd in Feb and finished my radiation end of April which I then immediately started the Tamox . I feel like I have gone through so much emotionally and physically that I just can not seem to take on another surgery . They can not do anything but a Dorsi Flap which is very involved and a 6 week recovery . I was hoping for a implant as that would be the fastest surgery and recovery time but unfortunately there is not enough breast tissue to hide the implant . My husband says he is fine with how I look and does not want me to take on anymore than I need to . I thought that I was fine with my decision too until I saw my Radiologist who questioned me and now is making me rethink my decision . I know from reading a lot of your post that a lot of you have undergone many surgeries to correct what this horrible disease has done to your body . Do any of you regret your decision and wish that you just left it alone . I am worried and do not want to go through anymore than I have to and I thought I felt good about my descision , but what happens later on down the road when I am so sick of making sure my fake is in correct ? Will I regret my decision later on , that I took the LAZY way out !!!!! How does one really know for sure ? June . "

Cupcake - I do n't know much about rads , but is the big reddened area one burn ? I thought it was a tiny beam of light that was angled to zap tiny pinpoint areas ? It looks painful and sore . I 'm glad you said it is ok . I finished chemo today and have been so excited all day ! I walked into chemo crying like a baby -LRB- fear of the unknown -RRB- and walked out with my head high and with a smile on my face . We made it ! "
2,TRUE,"I have a very bad feeling about this . My surgeon mentioned nothing about it when I had my surgery in March . My tumor was in the lower inner quadrant -LRB- between 6 and 8 o'clock -RRB- the perfect position for it to get to the IM nodes . I am sooo scared . I knew this was going to happen to me once I finished treatment -LRB- tomorrow is my last rads -RRB- . I 'm getting myself all `` whipped up into a frenzy '' . I have been very positive about the whole thing but now I 'm really starting to wonder if it 's all gone . Let 's face it , I do n't have the best case scenario -LRB- I know , even if you do you can still have a recurrance -RRB- . My tumor was 2.5 cm , in the lower inner quadrant , a micromet and I have an oncotype score of 32 . I 'm going to ask my radiation oncologist about this tomorrow to see if she can shed some light on this subject . "
0,TRUE,"Last week I underwent breast reduction surgery -LRB- surgery in conjunction with upcoming breast reconstruction surgery due to my mastectomy -RRB- . The doctor had taken me off of ALL pain meds 2 weeks before this surgery . I had been taking Aleve for joint/bone pain from Femara side effects . Three days of being off this medication - I felt like an arthritic old lady -LRB- I 'm 57 -RRB- . The pain was intense and my whole body ached . I had no idea how much the Aleve had been helping with my pain . Well , long story short - I made the decision to go off my Femara until at least after the surgery or until I was able to go back on the Aleve . I have been off the Femara for almost 3 weeks now and I ca n't tell you how wonderful I feel - this is one week after the surgery ! I feel human again ! In February , it would have been two years of either on Femara or Arimidex . I have decided - I 'm done ! I know my oncologist is going to kick and scream at me - but I 've reached the decision that I want ME back ! I 'm done dealing with this little yellow pill ruining my quality of life . I just had a breast reduction surgery in my `` good '' breast - no cancer found . I 'm having breast reconstruction surgery -LRB- Tram Flap -RRB- in a couple months and I will finally have a `` chest '' again . I look forward to being able to buy a regular bra - no prosthesis ! I 'm on the road to getting ME back ! If the Big C does enter my life again - I will deal with it at that time . NO ONE has shown me WHY we have to stay on this lousy little pill for a full 5 years . There are NO studies of it ALONE for 5 years showing true results . I 'm counting on my time served on this pill as being enough . I 'm also a no-nodules involved survivor - if I was n't - maybe I 'd be thinking different . I applaude all of you for your determination & stamina , Best wishes to each and every one of you now and those to come that have to deal with this horrible life-changing disease ! Hugs ! "

Sure wish we would get some rain . It was 103 here yesterday and felt like110 . The ac was working over time and still it was hot . And we are still in June ! Ca n't imagine what it will be like in July and August . The grass fires have been terrible here and we have been under a burn ban off and on for months . The fire station is just down the road from us and you can hear the alarms 5 or 6 times a day.Everyone is keeping the hose ready to go just in case we need to hose down the roof and yards.Don ' t need a storm just a slow gentle rain will work fine .
4,TRUE,"I too am on this trip since Dec. 2008 . Right now the chemo I am on is treating me well and there has been some regression in the cancer . The first year of treatment I can not say treated me nicely at all . To many hospital stays and really sick , chemos that did not work . It is all a part of the game we are playing . I am happy to say that now things are going smoothly . It is a roller coaster ride for sure so strap yourself in and plan on an interesting trip . "
0,TRUE,"Hi , I am so sorry that you have to go through this twice , once is bad enough ! I do n't want to dump more bad news on you , but did anyone ever tell you that expanders and radiation usually do n't work well together ?

But if they do n't , please do n't give up , there are always other options !

0,TRUE,"Shrink , that has to be very discouraging . But hold tight to the thought that better days are ahead . Two years ago this week , I was wondering if it was my last Christmas season . I was on Xeloda/Taxotere for a recurrence and probable -LRB- I still do n't trust PETs -RRB- spread to some nodes in my chest . It was harder than the first time around , mentally . So I can see how the MRI being wrong was a blow . It 's a hard road , but you 'll get there . And do n't you ever feel like a wimp . Mary , no snow here , but it was below freezing for the first time of the year this morning . Took us a whole day yeseterday to get Nathan 's room clean .

0,TRUE,Ladies seems we have been quiet around here lately.Is everyone okay ? I hope so . So tomorrow is my last and final chemo ... hip hip hooray . What a journey . Funny thing well at first not so funny . I signed in for blood work today and the manager said `` Oh Lisa here is your Dec schedule for tx . I almost fell on the floor . I said oh no thank - you ... I am on the short pass not the extended stay . She laughed and apologized but I was a deer in headlight ... what did she know that i did n't . but was just an scheduling error thank goodness . I need to go monthly for heparin to keep my port from blockage and then there is a debate as some take it out right away or others leave it in for a yr . So I am transitioning to a new road . I wish for all to keep up the fight and fight well When life gives you lemons make lemonade is my thought for the day . May you ladies have less side effects as the further tx goes along . Cross each tx off and say I did it and each cross off gets you closer to that day when we all cross that finish line . It does n't matter how long it takes to get there just that we cross that line . I would like very much to cont with this group and I will be joining the rad group . Know that each post has touched me thank you . Enjoy the rest of the night . I am off to work at hospital tonight and chemo in am . Best Wishes Lisa
2,TRUE,"I have had reconstruction twice . The process itself was positive the first time , but the fact that the expanders failed because of my radiated skin was not positive ! However , there was a light at the end of the tunnel . I had a second reconstruction after living without breasts -LRB- again -RRB- for over a year when I went to New Orleans and had hip flap surgery with Dr. Sullivan last August . I love my breasts . They are warm , they jiggle and they are all me . He even managed to make them the same size , given that the radiated side started out concave after the expanders had been removed . And as an added bonus , my hubby loves them too ! Good luck to you ! "
0,TRUE,"I have n't been here for awhile , but just wanted to update everyone on my experience with Budwig . I was diagnosed 2/17/09 with IDC and started Budwig on 3/6 -LRB- actually , was doing Henderson Protocol initially , which incorporated only a small component of Budwig with ALOT of supplements -RRB- . Gradually , I weaned myself off the supplements and eventually became 100 % Budwig compliant ... well , as close as I can possibly get to 100 % . I did have a lumpectomy on 4/30/09 , but no radiation , chemo or tamoxifen . Surgery is the only conventional treatment I will take . I recently had my follow-up mammogram/ultrasound and got the all-clear ! I just met with my onc last week to update blood work and this is the very exciting part ... my CA 15-3 -LRB- breast cancer marker -RRB- has dropped by 30 % since the baseline test was done in July -LRB- I wish they would have done one pre-surgery , but I did n't know what to ask for then -RRB- . At any case , I 'm thrilled with this result and it is just the confirmation I needed . Along the Budwig road , I have dabbled with various supplements , but I 've got to tell you , I think they can be counter-productive . The only ones I still take are D3 -LRB- when I ca n't get regular natural D from the sun -RRB- and DIM -LRB- I am 95 % ER + -RRB- . I tried the Iodoral -LRB- iodine -RRB- for awhile , but after being on it about 6 weeks , I truly felt like it was doing more harm to my thyroid than help . So , I 'm happy to say I 'm feeling great on Budwig alone -LRB- especially since being more committed to the juicing aspect -RRB- and am saving ALOT of money since I 'm not buying all those supplements anymore .

0,TRUE,"You guys might want to give Acetyl-L-Carnitine a try . From a couple of small studies done , it can actually reverse and heal some of the nerve damage . Since it 's an OTC supplement , it would be easy to try it . It certainly would n't hurt . I 'll be doing it next time I get chemo that causes neuropathy . Since Taxol worked very well for me , I 'll probably be doing it again down the road if I can counteract the neuropathy . "
5,TRUE,"Well , it looks like I 'm back on the chemo train . Went to have liver biopsy and the Dr. decided not to do it because of the location of the tumor . It is at the top of the liver right against the diaphragm and the aorta , therefore too much risk of puncturing a lung or the aorta itself . As a result of that and a close look at the scans again , both Dr. Manfredi and Dr. Redd -LRB- the one who was to do the biopsy -RRB- agreed that it still had the characteristics of a cancerous tumor so we would start a new chemo regimen . I will now be taking Avastin at the cancer center every other week -LRB- that is the short one - only about 30 min to an hour -RRB- and will take a new chemo , Xeloda , in pill form -LRB- 7 days on and 7 days off -RRB- at home . This will go on for 8 weeks then we will rescan to see if this chemo has taken care of this remaining tumor . All other areas still remain cancer free after the initial rounds of chemo . The good thing about this treatment is that it will mean less time off work -LRB- the avastin treatments will be on Friday afternoons -RRB- for treatments/Dr . visits . "
3,FALSE,"Lindy123 - Most people doing research about nutrition and lifestyle things that help prevent recurrence and cancer pretty much agree on many things . Antiinflammatory diet -LRB- no white , flour , rice , potatoes , sugar -RRB- like the Mediterranean diet , loads of veggies and fruits , especially cruciferous ones like brocolli , cabbage , brussel sprouts , green tea , spices like turmeric , cinnamon , ginger . Exercise like walking 30 minutes 6 days a week . The book I like best is Anticancer-A New Way of Life by Servan-Schreiber -LRB- thanks BarbaraA ! -RRB- . It is written by a doctor who had a brain tumor twice . After the recurrence , he started researching why his body was allowing/encouraging cancer to grow . It is very readable with loads of scientific evidence . Now that I have completed all the medical treatments , it gives me a feeling of empowerment to work on the other areas that I feel will keep me healthy . "

I am her only caregiver and petrified how this will effect her . It is 7 weeks since I found an inverted nipple and while I have had core biopsy still have many tests etc to go through . So far I have not told her but she is suspicious and i am very sharp because I do not want her to know . Am i wrong ? i seem to be more concerned as to how I will take care of her than i am with what lies ahead .

0,TRUE,"Hi Erin ! This sounds just like my story . I found a lump in my right breast which turned out to be IDC and when I had the MRI done during the pre-treatment testing a spot was found in my left breast as well . It too turned out to be IDC , a separate primary tumor . I had a few freak out days but then it settled in and it made treatment decisions easy for me . Chemo was a definite already due to my age -LRB- 36 -RRB- and two invasive tumors but if I had been on the fence about Bi-lateral Mx before this I was no longer . I did chemo first and then had my surgery almost a year ago , June 30 to be exact . I did immediate reconstruction and finished recon with implants in December . It was a long road but so worth it . The way I looked at it is that you read about so many having recurrence in the same breast or the other breast a few years later and it means chemo and surgery again . We know our enemy now and can fight it all at once . I know that it feels like getting diagnosed all over again and you feel completely out of control but give yourself a little time , IF it does end up being cancer on the other side , and realize that it does not affect your outcome . One or two , it is all the same . Treatment will depend on the bigger or more aggressive of the two . My bigger tumor completely disappeared after chemo . The smaller one , the little buggar found with the MRI shrunk but did not do away completely so bilateral mx put an end to that . I guess what I am trying to say is that I have walked in your shoes and I am now over a year out from diagnosis -LRB- diagnosed Jan 2009 -RRB- and doing great . You will be too . You can do this . PM me if you have any questions that I can help you with . Best wishes and take care ! "

0,TRUE,"So great to see this site . I have been reading your comments all along while getting treatment for for Stage 1 IDC . I have my last treatment tomrrow , so graduation , but still not looking forward to it . I was doing well emotionally , but have started down the road of recurrence fear . I am 40 years old and still do n't believe this , but I guess I am not a spring chicken anymore . If I read about 5 year survival one more time I may scream . I wa n't to hear about the 40 and 50 year survival stats - cause I know they 're out there ... ONC Type 17 . Any positive feedback is good feedback . And to one of sisters , my tumor was 2cm . "
0,FALSE,"Good Morning Jewels - So , how is everyone doing this morning ? Carol-Good luck with infusion # 4 today . Sorry you got hit by a lack of energy yesterday ... is n't it weird that it just hits like that out of the blue after feeling pretty good ? I 'm thinking that 's what happened to me the past few days ... feeling good just not as energetic . Appears today is a better day . I wake up as if I 'm going to work still , so I 'm thinking that could account for your waking at 5am this morning . How sweet of the shop you work with to send a care package ... leggings with lace eh ? Hope you find something wonderful for the dh . I have no clue ... plan to make dinner , have a card , but a gift ... not yet . Jenn - I still maintain you 're a SHERO ... and your dh is definitely in line for a gold star !!!!! So , when you 're down , how does your dh get to work being legally blind ? Bringing home payroll suggests you guys own your own business ... what do you guys do ? Julie-I 'm so sorry that you had another migrain . Bless the dh for giving you your shots and hopefully keeping the kids occupied while you deal with your mirgrain . If it is a snow day , why is your principal at school , and why would you try to drive an hour to meet with him ? Driving is n't recommended on snow days is it ? I used to live in Alpine Meadows in Lake Tahoe , and my mom was a principal at the time , and one day we could n't get the cars dug out and the plows had n't made up to us yet , so she snowshoed to the main road , which had been plowed , ... a good couple of miles ... . talk about dedication . I promise , I 'm really not doing that much at all these past few days . D1 - There are some very good Pinots and Merlots out there for sure ... have you tried chocolate and a good Syrah ? That too is delightful . I 'm more of a red girl ... have to have a nice hot day for white ... although a good buttery Chard can be wonderful with a light salmon meal . I tried an Italian red last night , which I could taste ... . yeah !!!! It was an Alianigco -LRB- sp -RRB- . Hey Denise - Welcome ... and you are too fun !!! You 're so going to fit in to our group . I would like to suggest you take an afternoon and put that novel down and read our thread from the beginning . You will get more advice about heading off the se 's than you can shake a stick at . We 've all done the digestive distress , lack of sleep , blahblahblah ... and the list goes on . You 'll also get a good laugh along the way . We have tshirts , too , which you 'll read about , so make sure to order one . Kathy-About the depression , we certainly will be here for each other even after chemo and rads is over ... there 's a slew of us who will be doing HT -LRB- and that has a whole list of potential se 's to discuss and get through -RRB- and those doing Herceptin , which must have se 's ... and if we do experience that let down ... which I understand ... going from the known to the unknown again . I ca n't imagine not being online with all of you Jewels even after we return to our new ` normal ' . Once again ... you were just getting stuff done yesterday , girl ... and in bad weather ! Bummer that this morning your digestive track has taken a turn . Hopefully , it 's just a delayed se , or something you ate , and not a virus . Sorry you 're on your own with the kids this afternoon and evening when you 're feeling ucky . Maybe you 'll feel better by this afternoon . Sista - Hey , sorry tx2 knocked you on your butt . It did me , too . I 've craved things , too . I really like eggs more than usual . I craved white rice with butter and tuna . Welcome to the baldacious babes club . I agree that having Jewels ahead of you in treatment is so helpful ... thanks D1 for being ahead of me . :--RRB- So , how much does the tooth fairie pay these days ? Kris - Are you on a steroid high ? You 're sounding really great !!!! New hardwood in the bedroom ... nice ! Too funny about pulling the hair out in front of the dh . Yep , it 's almost time to do the big shave , girlfriend . Hope you do n't need antibiotics this time around . Hey , I wonder if that 's the same semi that hit me after my tx2 ? Get back under those covers and just take it easy . CarolC-OK , I so do n't want to deal with red , itchy , peeling skin and sore feet . I 'm sorry your have to deal with that SE . Hope you got a few extra winks after your post and are feeling up to another day at work . Paula - So glad you got a relatively good night 's sleep . You 're still working being sick ? Speaking of work ... you do have a great work place ... that 's so cool everyone wearing hats in your honor , and how appropriate to get an edible basket since you craved fruit after tx 1 and can use the good vitamins now . ARDeb - Well that sucks ... being tired and now dealing with with the runs ... it seems we are faced with the extremes , eh ? I 'm with you on wondering about the cumulative effects ... I was worried about 6 , but you have 8 . Hang in there . SIS Kimberly "

6,TRUE,"I agree with all of you ladies it is so very important to let people know to research exactly where the proceeds go when they donate to a BC Cause because like it or not in alot of cases only a small portion goes towards research for the cure . I am new to all of this and my journey with BC came at a early age 38 , I am not married , single income , paying a mortgage & working full time . God bless my amazing boyfriend for trudging thru this jouney with me , we have had alot to deal with in the last few months but one thing we can not believe is the cost of the bills that are being sent to my insurance company ... really , for goodness sakes why would a CT & simulation before my radiation treatments started cost $ 16,000.00 it is insane . My outpatient lumpectomy surgery was $ 19,000.00 Everyday when I open these bills I can not believe my eyes , makes my heart hurt for those that have no insurance , thank god I do but it is still costing me a boat load of money , 20 % that I have to pay until I reach my $ 6000.00 yrly max then 100 % is paid but that 20 % adds up FAST !!!!! So when I go to safeway a few days throughout the week & they ask me if I want to donate I just have to snicker , if only they knew ! I am sure to always research where donations are going that is for sure ! I sure hope the health care system gets put under control some day as well ! "

4,FALSE,"Good morning gals ! Thanks to all of you for the Happy Birthday Wishes !! It was a good day complete wih church , a breakfast cooked by Dave , a few hours alone while he viisted his Mom -LRB- as I was n't sure the ride would help my back -RRB- , a phone serenade from my little grandsons , 9 holes of golf -LRB- played poorly but at least I was swinging the club again -RRB- and dinner out ! Who could ask for more ???? Burr ... it 's cold in the house this morning and I 'm still waiting for summer to appear . Looks like I 've got a LONG wait now ! LOL I 'm truly not ready for Fall and definitely not ready for Winter . Today I 'm meeting with another newly diagnosed gal through the Reach to Recovery program . We 've chatted on the phone and she seems so nice . It 's amazing but she lives close enough that I could even walk to her place . I hope I 'll be able to say something that will make this diagnosis and the upcoming journey easier for her . This afternoon I 'm back to the chiropractor . Thanks for all your suggestions , Susan . Believe me , I am ready to try anything . I am doing a little better , though. , It did n't hurt to swing the golf club yesterday and he assures me that the exercise is not making it worse -LRB- and supposedly getting the blood flowing to the inflamed area -RRB- but my back did tighten up again after the exercise . At least there appears to be some hope now . Annette ... you are just chugging right through those rads . I 'm so glad that you 're doing well with them ! Hugs to all of you !

0,TRUE,"Hi Kerry ... good to plan ahead . I too had a bilateral mastectomy - September 2007 . Like the other ladies have said , things that do up in the front are great - zippered hoodies , button shirts and loose pants with elastic waist -LRB- easy to pull up -RRB- are great . Have n't heard about the bra from the hospital - I did n't have that . The bandages were actually pretty easy to address . My surgeon told me that as long as there was no seepage , I could leave them off after 36 hours to allow the air to help with the healing . I was only in the hospital some 24 hours and then home . I was allowed to shower 48 hours post surgery as long as I did not directly soak the wounds . I did have a drain . I tied 2 shoe laces together and pinned the drain onto them around my neck . The drain has a pin -LRB- like a safety pin -RRB- which clipped to my underwear and/or top - depending on your comfort . My other suggestion - keep some glasses / dishes on top of the counter . Reaching into cupboards will not be easy - good exercise but not easy at first . Make sure you have some cream that your surgeon approves ... sometimes the tape can irritate your skin . As someone else said too ... the anaesthetic and pain meds can cause constipation . Make sure you are eating fibre and/or taking some stool softeners so that there is no `` additional '' pain with passing stool . Do try to eat as well as you can ... keeping your body strong will help healing and will also help your body prepare for the road ahead - be it chemo or radiation or something different . Go slow , take care and do the exercises ... getting your mobility back is important and will also help your mental wellbeing . Think positive ... I was pleasantly surprised at how little true pain there was in the bilateral mastectomy . PS - do n't worry about the prosthetics just yet ... I was about 3 months before I thought about it . Having had a large chest pre-surgery , I 'm enjoying the freedom of the surgery - ha !!! Laura in Victoria , BC Canada "
2,FALSE,I had an area deep inferior to my lumpectomy light up on a pet . My surgeon was sure it was scar because my MRI which was 8 weeks earlier was clean save the primary tumor . Now I have a doubt and do n't know what to do . What did your 's turn out to be ?
5,FALSE,Thank goodness I found this thread . I thought I was losing it . I have gained 6 pounds since beginning chemo . Have gained a total of 11 pounds since bilat mastectomy in June . I have never been this heavy my whole life ! I had my last treatment 2 weeks ago . About 7 days ago I cut my calories to 1200 and started to weight train with heavy weight and do intense cardio daily . I actually gained 3 pounds this week ! I was so frustrated and disappointed that my clothes are still tight and the scale wo n't budge . Sounds like I need to just keep it up and need to just give it time .
6,TRUE,"Binney , can we get LE from radiation only , without mastectomy ? yeah ... ca n't wait to start rads ... actually I am in the same boat as a few of you , I wanted to wait for nicer weather and now I ca n't wait to get it over with . brst26 , whenever I see your age I feel for you that you have to go through all this before 30 .

I 'm not trying to scare anybody , but I just need to tell someone . I woke up with literally every single part of my body hurting , and not even Lortab 10 is making it better . My muscles , joints , bones and head all hurt . And since I 'm taking the strongest pain med they usually give , I have a feeling I 'm stuck . I was able to maintain my composure around my 7-year old , as it scares him to see mommy in pain . But its taking every ounce of my mental strength not to break down today . I will work from home today , and hopefully feel better later . I have parent - teacher conference tonight , so I need to figure out how to make this right . I hate to be a whiner . I will say that I am grateful the first couple of days were n't horrible , and I 'm looking at the light at the end of the tunnel that I know is there .

0,TRUE,Had my SNB done yesterday and doing really well today . They sent me home with 60 percocet but have n't had to take anything not even motrin.tylenol . I think having my port placed was worse pain . Chemo should start as planned next Thursday . Scared but ready to get this whole thing started so I can be on the road to being done .
6,TRUE,I still have a pressing question about my DCIS as well . I am in a similar boat as kmarkou . My mastectomy cleared the margins for the primary tumor . But my DCIS was extensive and did NOT clear the margins . How can cells that are contained within the milk ducts be found in the surgical margins if they were DCIS and not invasive cancer ? The milk ducts were removed with the breast . The DCIS was contained in these milk ducts . I still ca n't understand this !
4,TRUE,"Hi all ! I just wanted to chime in on the Clomid thing again . I think it is strange that so many of us on here took it and ended up with BC in our 30 's however I did ask about it when I was diagnosed and told that they did not believe that there was a correlation but who knows , right ? My oncologist and I were saying it must have been the big microwaves in the ' 80 's or playing Atari as children ... lol . In other words no one knows why we got it or else they could cure it . I would like someone to study fertility meds and BC , though . So many of us on here took Clomid because we were in our 30 's and trying to get pregnant and I know my gyno gave it to me like it was nothing so I assume that is a common practice . I also know several women that took Clomid and have beautiful children now and no BC diagnosis . Who knows ? I am hating the cancer ride at this moment because I have to get an ultrasound tomorrow to rule out a swollen node on my left side . It is most likely scar tissue but I have scanxiety again . On a happier note our home passed our adoption inspection today with flying colors . Next step BABY ! No Clomid needed this time , no morning sickness , no stretch marks ... I am really starting to like this idea : -RRB- "
0,TRUE,"Hello all thought I would share my last visit to the Med Onc , he decided to check for blood clots due to some tenderness in the calves and more frequent cramps . all is fine but he stressed to make sure I note any changes and to make sure to report any further changes or unusual pain that i have not had before . I then was given a flu shot , on my way home the nurse called and said that she had made a mistake and given me a double dose . She called the CDC , the serum manufacturere and all assured her I would be fine but may have a sore arm and run a fever for a few days , minor flu like symtons and yup I am . Last year no side effects . She was very apologetic , I felt good that they had coverd the bases and checked with everyone to make sure all would be ok . All done with my Rads Onc . I am one of the few who has a chronic rash on my radiated breast that may not go away and may give me minimum discomfort as it does now . At least I know , he also told me not to be concerned if I get veins showing in my breast a few years down the road . I really am feeling well so no complaints . I am heading our to Albuquerque to see my son , brother , SIL , nieces and nephews . We are also going to Beer Fest in Albuquerque for Octoberfest !!!!

0,TRUE,HUGS to you Connie and all the other BC Survivors . I felt like I had written your post . My question is how did you find out about the diagnosis of RIF . I finished Accelerated Partial Breast Radiation Therapy in May '08 and have been miserable since Sept. ' 08 . Seems one issue would go away and another showed up in it 's place . The latest has been lingering 18 mos . The first I had heard about RIF was from my new family doctor . I hope you are on the road to recovery and have excellent health care providers working for you . God Bless < 3
0,TRUE,"thanks . Our PS said he does n't like to do DIEP if she will need radiation . Ah the confusion ; here we 've been assuming that she will have a unilateral mastectomy and DIEP at the same time , but we wo n't know if she 'll need radiation until after the mastectomy . I 'm wondering if she really just just have the unilateral/TEs and worry about DIEP down the road . "

2,FALSE,"Hello everyone . I 'm new to this board . I developed lymphedema in my left arm when I was undergoing chemotherapy .

I was researching the use of LED light for healing -LRB- a different medical problem , LOL ! -RRB- . It appears that there is little , if any , difference in LED vs laser for healing - it 's the wavelength that matters . There are many positive NASA studies on the use of LEDs in healing . 880nm infrared LED devices are available for $ 125 or less - this seems closest to the 904nm Rian Corp laser wavelength . There are also 660nm wavelength devices available also , a wavelength that has been shown to promote skin healing , but that might not penetrate deep enough to affect the lymph system and to soften fibrosis . Has anyone tried one of these LED devices for lymphedema ? "

0,TRUE,"Xray girl - I have not been active on the forum for a while so I am catching up and in need of support myself . I will tell you to take your time , I had a deflated TE for months and my PS threw a fit when he found out how long thinking he would need to re do expand . I said no way . This is my first saggy boob ever now I 'm fifty and just make it match the one that had the rads -LRB- which was way up on my chest due to rads -RRB- . Anyway to his surprise the deflatedTE side did not shrink up . I waited for many different reasons for the exchange . One was I got a new job and worked like crazy and got out of the BC world for a while and wore business/dress atire and had some fun . No one knew until I told them . I made a list of pro cons for both and looked at the items , read and chatted here with women and spoke with 6 women in local in my area that had different surgeries . My main concerne was the foob made from my stomach would grow and shrink different than the natural side . At the time I was 48 and was a 34/36 D . But when my weight would go down I would be a C or B . If the new foob acted like stomach fat what would I look like ! -LRB- Before I decided on Double Mast -RRB- At the time with my type of cancer which was not text book so 2 tumor boards at major Houston hospitals gave opinions on treatments . I decided that I wanted the shortest fastest recovery route - which was implants . My doctor wanted to wait 6 months after my rads -LRB- I did not have chemo -RRB- to do exchange but that put us in a rush to extend the tissue -LRB- about a month before rads and not a happy memory -RRB- I ended up having 2 more surgeries expander out then back in due to infection but doc did new procedure on me and wrote a medical paper so I hope it helps others with TE infections . I was worn out after all of that and with a new job and my procrastination I waited 2 years to do the exchange . Which my doctor is now ok with , he said the more time to heal the better the chances . My % were similar to yours I remember something like 40-60 % failure rate and after all my other surgeries I just put it off . I am glad now and so is my PS doctor he has not given me the % but he thinks the implant will stay , he did have to clean up lots of the scar tissue . My cancer type comes back the first 2 years your out look is not so good , so I thought why would I spend that time getting foobs and operations when I could be living a pretty nice life with my family and do the surgery after the 2 years when the outlook is much better for a longer time before recurrence . Read , listen and follow your heart & gut feeling . The few times I did not follow my gut feeling , later I regretted it . Doctors are great and educated but they are not always smarter about what you need . I wish I could help many others with what I have learned but every one has such a different road ahead you have to figure some of this out for your self . My breast onc told me I prob . saved my own life by refusing standard textbook treatement from another oncolg . with my cancer . I knew something was not right and I had read more about my type of cancer than the onc . that was treating me . That does make me feel a little better . This forum is full of support from wonderful women that just want to help you feel the love and have the life you deserve . Love & Hugs to you while you think over all of your decisions . "
0,TRUE,"Dear all , wow a lot of activity happening this week . Thanks to everyone for sharing so much of your early experiences ... my planning session is tomorrow and I 'm ready to get on with it , armed with so much info on what to expect . Big snow storm is expected to start here in Chicago in another hour or so with heavy accumulation by morning so here 's hoping I 'll still be able to get to the cancer center . I 'm interested -LRB- as so many others -RRB- in what their recommendations will be re creams . I 've read alot about Lindi Skin Care , and it 's sold at a couple of Women 's support stores/centers here in the area . I purchased some Radx Moisture Therapy -LRB- for using a few days prior to starting tx -RRB- , and Radiation Therapy -LRB- for using once symptoms appear -RRB- . I 'm expecting though that the recommendation will be Aquaphor which is available OTC retail at drug stores , Walmart , Target , etc. . Time to get this show on the road ... back to you after tomorrow 's session . "
0,TRUE,"Yes . Mine were hormone sensitive and we just thought that it would be adding fuel to the fire . A few years down the road , though , they would have cleared me for a pregnancy as long as I was still without recurrence of course . Onc told me absolutely no way for a pregnancy the first year after treatment . He said that studies have shown that this is dangerous . The doc that said the risk might be minimal might be correct and there have been other women that have chosen to go ahead with the egg or embryo freezing -LRB- and the hormones needed to make that happen -RRB- . I just felt it was too close for comfort for me . I guess it really depends on how much you really want a biological child , as egg donors are still an option for an assisted pregnancy after treatment .

0,TRUE,"bc in colorado , you did the logical progression of being conservative . We all want to avoid addtional procedures down the road . My first step put me at totally normal and extremely greatful this procedure could be done in comparison of the radical back in the 70 's , total elation . Speaking only for myself , as I felt better , I got `` picky '' and felt that if I had to go through the pain of the bmx , and PS visits that I wanted it to look even better . I 'm not a vain person . I felt why should n't I look like this or that when I learned what could be done and found a PS I trusted . Being more specific , is if I went through all this I should be able to wear a cammi without a bra , or a workout top without a bra under it , thus the lift . If I lived up north and dressed all covered up all year this probably would n't have been an issue . So I think its even regional . In Fl due to humidity we are all skin all the time . halter tops , cammi 's etc. where the divots will show . I think one should go into the one step expecting two steps . LOL . Hurley wants to look like she does in her pic once the expander is out and its not knowing how your implants will settle in .

I am in 2 minds about this and I am hoping you ladies can shed some light on it all !! As you might know I have been on the rollercoaster from hell with all of this liver stuff . The initial liver dx was mets and I was treated for it which literally nearly killed me , put my family through living hell -LRB- my children are still suffering from it - my eldest just had an appt with child and youth mental health on top of all the other child psychologists and behaviouralists -RRB- and just about destroyed all of us . Then they said it was n't mets so stopped treatment . Then we do n't know so we 'll treat as it was just incase . Now the same onc and same radiologist are saying it never was mets !?!! How do I believe them ? How do I know THIS is the right diagnosis ? No new scans have been done since 6 months ago so its not as though new info has come to hand its like they have just `` decided '' . People have said to me that it is great news -LRB- which it is obviously ! -RRB- although the cloud of uncertainty this `` diagnosis '' has come under is just a bit much for me . How can they just decide this week its not mets after so much uncertainty when they were so SURE it was mets originally ? -LRB- Never had a biopsy due to the uncertainty of ` possible ' blood flow through the region-long story -RRB- I am really angry . Every day is filled with anger . And this was even before Friday 's newest diagnosis . I am white hot with rage most days . Am already on Lexapro which has been upped from 10mg to 15 to now 20mg . I am cancerfree which has been my dream , my friends and family are moving on from it all but I am just SO MAD . I can barely function - I scream incessantly at the kids , pick fights with just about everyone , have no patience or tolerance . My relationship with the kids is average at best -LRB- you may remember they are now 2 and almost 5 - new born and 2.5 yrs at dx -RRB- because of how mad I am . My partner and I are just holding on .

I 'm awed and inspired by the courage , grace , and strength I see here and I can only hope to have some of those if/when I get mets . At the same time I know stage IVs have their own set of issues , but I 'm thankful we can all share experiences and learn from others at different stages and situations than our own . I 'd hate to be limited to posting and reading from only people with my exact situation . I am afraid and I 'm wishing and hoping for the best for all of us , whether the `` best '' is cure , NED , pain relief , or peace at the end .

I love planning a project and finishing it gives me something to look forward to . I am always able to see what I want things to be like in my head and then work at it until they are that in reality . I NEED projects and something to keep me going ... be it decorating , making something , planning a menu for a party . I need to have something to look forward to and might just stay in bed if I did n't . Well , guess I could not do that since I do have to go to work , but I know I would be in the dumps with nothing to do . Which is my main complaint with my husband ... he is perfectly content to sit around and do absolutely nothing all day . My dog , Sydney was my rock . I bought him as soon as I finished my reconstruction because I knew then I would not be running to the doctor for fill-ups every week and that I was on the road to getting back to normal . It did n't work out like that because my cancer came back , but he was there for me . He always made me feel better , made me laugh when I was sad , was always happy to see me and never talked back . I went through a lot of boyfriends , but Sydney was always there . Everyone thought I would lose it when I lost that dog , but I had him for 17ξ1/2 years so he long outlived his life expectancy and I could not bear to see him suffer and he let me know when it was time .

I 'm 53 , and like a lot of you , seemed to be doing all of the right things to be healthy , but this disease does n't care who you are , what you do , etc. .

6,FALSE,"Hi Ladies , Well , I met the radiation doc on Friday and they did the scan and CT and this friday they will mark me and I will start rads on monday , I will have 33 tx , the doc and the staff all seem great . Today I have my 1st f/u with the chemo doc and also a f/u w/surgeon from surgery and I have an infection of the breast and was put on an antibiotic . So I am praying that the infection is gone so that it will not delay the start of rads . I have noticed that I have white fuzz on my face , I remember one of you posted about this before and was wondering what was the outcome ? did it stay or did it go ? Lord please do n't let it stay , I have some hair on the head , scalp is still not covered , but it is a start . With the weight gain , lack of hair , dry skin and knee pain , scars , and knee pain , I really do n't want face fuzz . Well , now on a more serious note , I know that we all deal w/things on different levels and all of our cases are different , and some worry more than others . I will share with you how I rationalize things in the hopes that it will maybe help someone else . First of all remember that a cancer dx is just that its a dx it is not a death certificate , you see you could worry yourself crazy about dying of cancer and then get hit by a car , fall off of a mountain , fall off of a boat etc and die , you see and cancer would have never taken your life . when we sit and worry about cancer killing us we give it the power that it does not have . we must stay in control and remember that cancer is just a bully . There have been many cancer pts that have been terminal that died in so many other ways and cancer was not the cause of death . And on the spiritual note on the creator can call you home . He knows when our last day will be and only He knows . Now this man that works with my hb , has one grandchild , who is 4 yrs old , they have just found 5 tumors on this childs small body , and it is cancer . They have given her a 30 percent chane to survive , so when we look at a child going through chemo , surgery , rads , its real hard not to see how blessed we are to have made it to this age and to remember that tomorrow is not promised to no man , and thatGod calls some home earlier than others , do we understand Gods reasons and plans?no , and we are not supose to , He and He alone is God the creator we are just the created . I hope that this helps some and offends none . Its just how I cope , we all must do and think in whatever way brings us peace and hope , I will check in with you all soon , blessings and hugs to you all , Renee "
2,TRUE,"Hi , lieberman ~ As other have said , reviewing our choices and asking what we might have done differently is very normal , and something your Mother needs to go through . And I totally agree that no one wants to hear a rah-yay pep talk about being positive . But in retrospect , one thing that helped me a lot were the suggestions my DH or DS would make about how things may have worked out for the better in the long run . In my case , I had mediocre doctors at first , which I kicked myself for wasting time with . But my DH kept assuring me that it all worked out for the best because it led me to go to UCLA for a second opinion . I had a lumpectomy when I needed a mast , and my DH said maybe it was better to get the news in smaller pieces , because maybe it would have been harder to handle all at once . In your Mother 's situation , what comes to mind is that chemo options have improved greatly in the past few years . While not getting bc is obviously the preferable scenario , you can point out to your Mom that there are wonderful new chemo drugs on the scene that were n't available 5 years ago . Small `` good thing '' -LRB- or other side of the coin , or glass half full -RRB- ideas like that can help to stop the negative thought processes and hopefully let in some light and hope . Deanna "
5,TRUE,"Wow , we certainly are a chatty group . D1/OLE and CarolC - Thank you for the compliment on my poetic musings . D1 - Lump ... in Little Frankenboob ? Could it be scar tissue ? Getting it checked out is obviously the right thing ... but question ? Did you have a PET scan or Breast MRI ? If I did n't have those , my surgeon stated they never would have known about the other two tumors I had . My mammo caught only one ... and the ultrasound found it no problem ... but when I asked that the Dr. do my underarm the ultrasound scan did n't catch the tumor under my arm because it did n't know exactly where to locate it , since it did n't show up on my initial mammo . The PET showed the other two ... on at 7:30 and one in the axillary . The breast MRI confirmed the original tumor and the one at 7:30 , but could n't see the one under the arm because it could n't see under my arms the way they positioned me . The surgeon stated that without those two tests , I would have had a lumpectomy . She felt the underarm tumor as soon as she knew where to locate it , but she had to press in pretty far to feel it . So , just want to make sure you were clear that your surgeon can only go by what info they are given ... not that a second opinion is n't always a good option ... just wanted to give the surgeon the benefit of the doubt . Hope your daughter has a good game tonight . Carol - You rock ... I 'll check out the website , then PM my order . I agree with D1/OLE that we need to include shipping and handling fees , so sending extra is a good idea . Sorry you 're feeling under the weather ... hope you are back in good form for Thursday . Vettegal-Glad to hear that you 're reconsidering your work schedule . I 'm just over a month out from surgery and still am shocked at how tired and sore my arms get . Where I had nodes removed took until about now to be able to lift that arm enough to really clean and shave ... not that you 'll be shaving with an inicision yet , but deodorant on either side of it should be OK . I agree about the washcloth and antibacterial soap helping to get any crusties taken care of ... gently . Sorry to hear that you too are suffering from a cold or flu . Take care of yourself . Welcome Deb3Girls and Jenn 51 - Carol as noted is not thrilled you had to join us , but happy to have some company on the Herceptin train . This is a wonderful group ... you 'll get so much out of it . CathyCA - Does n't it feel great to finally have a plan ? Not that you still wo n't have anxiety moments , but this has to be a big relief to at least have a direction . OK , now my news . Hope Deb did as well as I 've seemed to do so far . Well , I made everyone smile with my Supergirl Cape and martini glass . The nurses filled my glass 6 times -LRB- keeping hydrated is good ... get that chemical mix out of the system as soon as possible -RRB- while I was there , and other commented on my glass and how they wanted a chemotini too . HeeHee . I took about 2 hours and 45 minutes to get through my chemical mixture , so not too bad . Terrie , my older sister , was with me first half until about noon , and Kathleen , my twin , did the second half ... they did n't have room for two guests at one time . So far ... no SEs to report , though I do n't think they 'll kick in until day 3 if they are going to this round . The Neulasta shot tomorrow has its own SE 's to contend with ... but , personally I 've signed on for the no SE 's plan .

4,TRUE,"I was first diagnosed with DCIS in 1999 on the right . I had a mastectomy with reconstruction , no radiation or chemo . Last summer I started having leg pain that I thought was due to exercise . In August I had horrible back spasms and rib pain . I went to the doctor and they took a chest xray where they missed a compression fracture on the film . An way in December I finally had an MRI that showed metastatic disease - a biopsy confirmed it as metastatic disease from the orignial breast cancer -LRB- it was estrogen positive -RRB- . A bone scan showed involvement in the right trocantar as well . am currently on Femara and Zometa . I had to have a rod in my femur and pins to my trochanter -LRB- hip -RRB- . It actually relived the pain and made me more mobile . I have been at this only a month but I see progress every day . I will need surgery to stabilize the T9 fracture but I am hoping I can wait a while and control discomfort with PT . To top off my news I have new primary DCIS on the left and will have a mastectomy with bil reconstruction sometime in the next few months . If you look through the boards you will find that bone only mets is more of a chronic condition . Even if you get other involvement the tumors can shrink and go away . We all want to see NED on our chart -LRB- no evidence of disease -RRB- There is one women who has lived in Stage IV for 17 years . I am new to this too but I listen to my body and as I feel stronger everyday and my pain is managed with less medication I choose to enjoy each day .

And at my hospital I also had the office girls put a CA beside my name , that way rad techs would n't reschedule me and I could keep my ride , because they usually need at least 24 hour notice , but like I said are good in an emergency .

At midnight on saturday I broke down and took some vicadin and it has at least allowed me to get some sleep . the throbbing and jumping of my legs were just awlful . I have 3 more dose dense taxols and i will be soooo glad to get off of this ride . Yes it is soo much better than a/c but it has its evil side too , as for the rest of you that handled the pain w / aleve alone , you are my heros . like i said before I feel like a whimp and at this point I will take any help out there to cope w/the pain . Anyway sat sun mon were down days , but today has been much better , hoping each day will be brighter and better , thanks for allowing me to vent my thoughts are with you all , Tara will be thinking of you and your friend Issa you take care of yourself now and worry about your husband and the house later , sorry you have to deal w/this on top of everything else . Connie hope your throat gets better soon , Have you tried biotene mouthwash and toothpaste ? its found at walgreens and really works well , hopfully it will help your throat . I 'll post later hugs to you all . blessings , Renee "
0,FALSE,"Hi everyone-was reading some posts last night around midnight . There have been a few people that are on the same regimen as I am that have posted day 14 is the day their hair started coming out . I pulled on my hair , sure enough-big clump . Had me feeling weird-not upset really , I knew it was inevitable and my hair is short anyway , so I do n't think it 's going to bother me to be bald -LRB- who knows though huh ?! -RRB- . I guess it is the fact that it makes this whole thing REAL . I have had minor SE from the chemo and neulasta and have felt pretty good over the last 4 days-easy to kind of go into denial , especially now that I feel healed from my surgery . Started cleaning like a madwoman -LRB- control , you know -RRB- ! Remember that `` mental clarity '' I mentioned earlier ... clear mind went out the window once the hair started coming out-the hairs must be little pieces of brain on them because I was in a fog all day , -LRB- and this was before dose number 2 today at noon today . -RRB- It was my firstborn 's twelfth birthday today and we had arranged a play date with someone that she likes very much and has never had the chance to get together with outside of school . Picked up the kids and friend after chemo and was driving down the road . Heard fire truck sirens and could see the truck coming toward us to the light I had stopped at . Once my light turned arrow green , I proceeded to pull out into the intersection before the truck passed-DUH ... Was n't a close call for accident or anything just totally improper etiquette . I told the kids that Mom is `` stupid '' today and they laughed . OK-so here 's something funny . I hope this is n't TMI but I have a few small hemorrhoids which have been bothering me because of loose stools -LRB- thank goodness not constipation ! -RRB- Anyway , I used some preparation H this morning . . After I at the cancer pavilion for a while-getting labs , seeing the onc . I used the restroom . I looked down at the inside of my khaki pants and there 's a line of `` grease '' from the prep H . A big one , mind you that goes up the back end and is entirely visible to anyone looking at me walk away . OMG-hilarious . I borrowed some scrubs for the rest of the visit . My family is going to crack up at this one !!! OK-this foggy girl is going to be getting ' to bed early tonight . Take care all . Laurie "
6,TRUE,"I found this discussion by accident last week and I was in tears reading the posts of other women struggling with this issue . I 'm not alone ! I was dx in March 2003 , had lumpectomy , rads , CMF chemo . I was 49 at dx and chemo threw me into full blown menopause . I have been very happily married almost 30 yrs and sex is important to both of us . I had the same problems as other posters - loss of desire , dryness , difficulity in reaching orgasm . Words do not describe my disappointment ! I beat bc and now this ! What the heck is going on ! Well , I was n't going to let this problem wreck an otherwise wonderful relationship . I went to my onc and said `` you guys have got to help me ! '' . My dr and the female NP at the cancer clinic have been wonderful , they 've offered lots of advice and suggestions but nothing like the support and ideas I 've found here . My dr said he believes this is the single most unreported problem breast cancer survivors suffer with . Anyway , here 's what I 've found that helped . I am taking ALOT of fish oil - double the recommended dose , a mega daily vitamin , natural vitamin E , and I started taking Arginmax about a year ago . All with the blessings of my onc . Also got a vibrator -LRB- a must have ! -RRB- and went to a few Passions Parties and picked up a few items . I also highly recommend Astroglide ! I keep looking for new things to try and `` His Royal Hardness '' is more than happy to participate in the product testing . I took tamoxifen for 1ξ1/2 years and had to stop as I could not tolerate it , also with the blessings of my onc . We also have to schedule sex for when I am rested , nights are out - mornings are in ! Things are much better , but I still am not where I was before this all happened . Anyone got any more great advice ? Let 's keep this great thread going ... I 'm sure it has helped many women in this same boat ! "

Just trying not to give it up completely until I finish rads and get my energy back .

4,FALSE,"Ok , today was officially the start of the better me . It was actually a notable day anyway as I had my lumpectomy exactly one year ago on 8/8/09 . So I think this is a good time for me to turn over a new leaf . I did my 40-minute bike ride this morning . Then I went mall-walking late in the day after my two-hour nap . Mall walking is not so good when one is open to being distracted by the stores , so that walk was very much stop and start . Once the mall closed at 6PM , I took to the streets around that area . It had cooled down somewhat and on any other day , I would have given up quickly but I was determined to do a total of 10,000 steps -LRB- 4.5 miles -RRB- and I did . So I feel very proud of myself tonight . Thank you for all the encouragement . "

I had another way anxious moment in the middle of the night -LRB- from 3a to 5A -RRB- I meditated for 2 hours and it passed but sometimes alone in the dark - it can be scary -LRB- my husband is in the other room b/c of this bad virus I picked up -RRB- .

2,TRUE,"Erin , Welcome back to reality . I hope you are adjusting well to the `` real '' life . Up to a year for the tingling to go away ! Yikes ! Did you get tingling in your feet or legs and your hands or just your hands ? My wife gets it mostly in her feet but sometimes she get shooting pains up her legs , too . Did you ever get that ? Maybe there 's something else going on with her . So far my wife has n't mentioned any bone pain although I know that is a very common side effect . Her onc suggested L-glutamine powder to help with that . My wife mixes a couple of teaspoons in with her pomergranate juice a couple of times a day . I do n't know if that has kept it under control or whether she just did n't get that particular side effect . Either way , I do n't think she 's going to stop and find out . Is n't it interesting : my wife seemed to breeze though A/C . Yes , she lost every bit of hair right after her second tx but she never got sick and , except for being a little tired for a couple of days after the treatment , she never let it get in the way of her normal activites . In fact , there were times I had to tell her she might want to slow down just a bit . -LRB- She did n't . -RRB- And with the 3 week break in between treatments it was almost like she was n't getting chemo . But I know so many have major problems with A/C . After chemo I think it will just be surgery and rads . She 's triple negative and I think -LRB- correct me if I 'm wrong -RRB- that Tamoxifin and Herceptin are only for cancers that are hormone receptor positive . I know her onc said she would n't be getting Tamoxifin and I remember reading that Herceptin is for her/neu2 positive . I 've read a couple of books on breast cancer and I 'm still not sure I fully understand that part of it so if I 'm heading down the wrong path here , let me know . Now her onc said she would n't get tamoxifin but she never said what my wife would get after it 's all over . I guess we should find out what the long term plan is . I 'll let her know that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that this wo n't last forever-only 8 more weeks . Her attitude has been really positive for the most part although the last couple of weeks have been really hard for her mentally . She 's not used to being tired and weak . Lately she 's been so tired we do n't make it to church on Wednesday nights and she misses that . She has so much she wants to do that she ca n't do right now , that she gets frustrated . I told her that I had read a post that said `` when do I get to stop being a patient and start being me again . '' And that 's what she 's looking forward to now : when she can stop being a patient and just be Sharee again . That 's her light at the end of the cancer tunnel . Well , talk about rambling on ! It 's after 10:00 pm here in SoCal and I think I 'd better get to bed . Thanks for listening . Larry `` It 's Friday but Sunday 's coming . '' "

Please do n't make the mistake of presuming because of your family history that you will follow this path . Treatment is light years better than it was even 5 years ago . You can and will recover and live a long life . You do not have to cancel your magazine subscriptions . Every one of us have been down this black hole of despair . It is hard , at night the squirrels come out and run around the room and drive you nuts with worry , we have all had this and more . I am a life long anxiety/depressive/panic attack person .

0,TRUE,"Hello , I have a question.Last week I felt a lump very near where the other 3 tumors were . I was n't to see the onc til Fri. so I went to family Dr. and she felt it and sent me for a ultra sound and it showed nothing . I did have onc . check it out yesterday and she said I need to have the surgeon check it out . I am going to wait til the last chemo Dec. 2nd to see him because he is an hour and a half away . I guess after I had the ultra sound results I was n't worried but after seeing the onc . she seamed a little concerned . Do you even think it is possible for a tumor to start while your having treatment ? That does n't seam possible . But when you think about it why is it more likely to show up in the first 2-3 years after treatment then later down the road . Do n't you think that should be the other way around , like you should be more protected in the 1st few years after tx ? Idk seams strange to me and hopefully if it nothing . It sure does scare you to feel something else.Just looking for some imput , Thxs "

0,TRUE,My husband reckons he could have written your letter . He is 55 and a retired toolmaker and I am 47 and was a credit controller in a medical equipment company . I am now a housewife . I had my lumpectomy and the node thingie op 2 weeks ago and I am ready to take the Autovilla and set up home in a camping site in Nelspruit -LRB- Mpumalanga S Africa -RRB- near the hospital for the next 2 months rather that live with him and then have to drive 200kms round trip for radiation . Two weeks and I want to hit the road and I think he wants to hit me . And this is just the beginning ... I myself have just 2 little words to say `` Be Nice '' Please that 's all we want . Just treat us as though we are a little bit special . Everyone seems to be under the impression that I have had like a mole removed or a tooth pulled - you know the tumour 's out so get back to normal but it 's not that simple . I am very grateful that the surgeon could do a lumpectomy and I get to keep my breast but this is cancer not an abcess and this is what no-one on the outside seems to get . And then for me the worse is that my husband is n't what one would call a ` boob man ' - so seeing as he is not that into breasts that makes it all that much worse for me . I wish sometimes that if the cancer was somewhere else he might be different . I alsoget so pissed off and angry and think that I wo n't even bother with the rest of the friggen treatment and maybe it would be best if nature just takes it 's toll and then I wo n't be in anybody 's way and I wo n't feel so sad anymore . My husband is a biker -LRB- BMW K1200GT -RRB- and we went for a ride on Saturday with our 25 year old son . It was great -LRB- but my oncologist said to me no alcohol and I have n't had any and it does n't bother me any -RRB- - but then he gets like all funny because I wo n't order a cider - a little ca n't do any harm he says . See what I mean . He just is n't taking this very seriously at all .
0,TRUE,"Tender ~ Thanks so much for taking the time to respond to my post . It is believed that this cyst did develop since my starting the Tamoxifen .

That would just be awful !! I have to make a final decision soon . The gynecological oncologist has ordered a CT scan of my pelvis/abdomen for this Thursday ~ apparently that will help to define what lit up on the PET scan . I 'm so tired of tests ...

2,TRUE,"My father was DX with breast canncer 8 years ago . Even though we have no other family history of breast cancer in my family I wanted to be proactive as it is rare for men to have breast cancer . Had my baseline mammo when I was 37 and was normal and was told not to come back till I turned 40 . I turned 40 early this year and went for my second mammo in March 2010 . I received a call back for additional pictures of the Rt breast . Second set of films showed microcalcifications -LRB- 80 % chance of being nothing -RRB- and a subsequent BX showed -LRB- I was in the crappy 20 % -RRB- 8 cm of DCIS in the Rt breast . Scary but 100 % treatable and not life threatening . Had a lumpectomy in April 2010 , and my world took a turn for the worst . Pathology showed 0.4 mm of invasive grade 2 , ER/PR + , HER - cancer with angiolymphatic invasion was reported present on path . Had genetic testing and was BRCA 1 normal BRCA 2 was `` suspected deleterious '' , which meant although not 100 % positive it should be treated as positive . In light of this I opted for a double mastecomy in early June just to be on the safe side and the pathology from this surgery showed to have no additional new invasive cancer since the April lumpectomy and the nodes were clean and negative . Had OncoDX test done and result was 21 , which put me in the low end of the intermediate group -LRB- gray zone -RRB- . Radiation was ruled out since double MX took care of the margins . Primary Oncologist is recommeding 4 cycles of T/C due to the angiolymphatic invasion found on the path report in April . She said if that had not been present she would not recommend chemo as the tumor was so small . However , got 2nd opinon from a Oncologist at Stanford , and they said they could recommend chemo but would not push -LRB- as my primary onoclogist seems to be doing -RRB- and they seem to be making this determination based upon tumor size even though angiolymphatic invasion was noted . Stanford also suggested Tamoxifan & Zoladex might be a good way for me to go instead of chemo , but my primary oncologist never suggested this . But of course Stanford said there is no right or wrong choice and it is ultimately my decision . That is what I am having a problem with . I dont have any children and was hoping to try this year -LRB- hence the check-up at my b-day -RRB- when all this was discovered . A fertility DR stated I have a 100 % chance of going into early menopause if I do chemo , which is of course a major concern for me . If I already had kids the decision of chemo would already have been made . However , the reality is I dont and would still like to . So now what do I do . Tamoxifan is a given as both Oncology Drs seem to agree that the majority of reduction of reoccurance -LRB- 7 % -RRB- will be from the hormone therapy . Meanwhile chemo would only offer and additional 3 % . I would be interested in knowing if any women are in a similar situation as mine . I really and truely do not know how to decide . It seems if I do what my primary onocolgist wants I will have to give up my dream of a child that is biologically mine , but if I dont do chemo and distant reoccurance occurs down the line how do I reconcile that I didnt do all that I could when I had the chance . Is anyone going through this as well ? "

0,TRUE,Got a call yesterday that I now have a bacterial infection in my bladder so back on SeptraDS/Bactrim DS . Now what ? Will this stop the chemo now scheduled for Tuesday ? Will they want to drop my infection properties with trying to battle this infection ? Pain is still away and I feel so good just feeling good . Been such a long weary road . Hope all is well with all you camp buddies ...
2,TRUE,"I am in a similar situation . Just diagnosed early this week with DCIS stage 0 , do n't know the grade . And am faced with the same questions . My mass was measured at 6cm so even before the biopsy was done , the BS suggested a DMX just based on the size . After the biopsy even the radiologist suggested I do the same . I spoke to my PCP yesterday who also agreed the best way to handle this would be a DMX . I am 39 and my husband is favoring the DMX with reconstruction , as he puts it , he can live without my breast , but ca n't live without me . I am not so nervous about the procedure , I have been wanting to go for breast reduction for some time now , this was n't the way I wanted to go about it , but I am trying to make light of the situation and look at the brightside ... I will have nice perky little new ones . And I am grateful that this is n't worse and there is a solution . You have to do what you feel is best for you ... personally I think that your breasts are n't as important as the rest of you . Whatever you decide , best wishes ! And please let me know how -LRB- if -RRB- it goes . I am nervous about this procedure too . "
0,TRUE,"SANAISA I am glad to see your post I was worried for you when i did not see you for a day or two . . i hope you are doing okay ... REMEMBER WE ARE ALL DOING THIS . . Finished chemo # 2 no real side effects again . I had my neulasta shot and my wbc today is 11 . I have mananaged to continue working as a Rn thru this ordeal because for me it is one thing that cancer can not control . I am a much better caregiver than receiver . I too got my period like normal like the above girls . # 3 tx is the day after my bday 10/27 that sucks but then i will only have 1 tx left . though I have been as you say a rockstar in the side efffect dept I feel i could be stronger when I think about the future .

6,TRUE,"Debra , I am exactly in your boat . I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with a tumour in my liver after having bone mets for 3 years . To be honest , I did not sleep at all in the first week , thinking that this is it . But now that I am clearer , and being on this website helps so much , I realise what everyone is saying , that our cancer is now called `` a chronic disease '' and can be controlled . Boy , I hope they are all correct . I was going on a trip too but I needed to cancel cause my doctor wanted me on Taxol Gemzar asap . He also did it because of bone mets progression . So I understand you entirely . Go on that trip if the doctor says yes and let us both show that we can survive this shit . "
2,FALSE,"What might I say after this wonderful news to our ears , yes Slonedeb ? I 've thought of you today also , knowing you had your chemo . I hope the needle was but a prick , and the infusions warm and without pressure on your vein , and the steroids if you got them still allow you sleep tonight , and your pain is numbed by pills . I hope a lot for you , that you remember your peace of mind , and if it 's gone for a while , like it always seems to go here on earth , that you let it back in as soon as possible .

0,TRUE,I was dx at age 35 . I am married and we were finally ready to start a family . My mother died 3 weeks before my dx-she had lung cancer and it was very bad . I felt the lump 6 moths before and told by gyn about it - she did a breast exam in Feb 06 and told me it was nothing to worry about-just fibrocystic tissue . 6 months later-i went to my interal medicine doctor about my thyroid-i am hypothyroidism . anyway-i told him about the lump and that my breast looked uneven and maybe i would need ps if it continues . He looked at it and immediatly ordered mammo and ultrasoud testing-i was so unprepared !! for some reason i thougt that he was going overboard-surly i did not have cancer !! anyway after several weeks-i ended up at the surgeons office and he told me that it had to come out-i still did not get it . He knew that i was in denial and said `` I am not saying you have breast cancer-just that I am concerned '' it was like someone threw water in my face-I think he helped me at least realize that this could happen to me . I was so mad because the gyn that I had trusted with my life for so many years-did nothing but a quick exam-she should have ordered a real test right then and there !! Because the cancer was in my body growing for so long-that is why I had to endure Chemo and Rad . If it was caught earlier-maybe only Rad . It has been two years now for me and i am cancer free-but my life is in emotional storm . Hormones i am sure-my cycles have returned but sporatic - i am on tamoxifen so this is to be expected . Will I have children-who knows ? I sometimes wonder if i even want to go down that road . I am trying really hard to just stay positive . Yes i am happy to be cancer free-but so scared that i no longer want the same things that i use to . . maybe this website will help me out-when i go to the local support group-i am like the baby there and i feel selfish for complaining because the older ladies to me seem very sick sometimes and i feel like i should be supportive instead of angry . anyone else feel the same ?
2,TRUE,Hi everybody ! I to have been on tamox for the last year with minimal side effects although se seem a little worse since my onc took me off paxil . I am wondering if any of you worry about effects of tamox down the rode . I have a friend who had bc 20 yrs ago . She was er + but does n't know her2 status . She also had lymph node involvement . Had chemo and tamox . 2 years ago she developed a recurrence-triple neg . How is this possible ? Was tamox to blame for triple neg ? Can anyone shed light on this ? I do worry about being on tamox mostly because I do n't want triple neg cancer someday .
5,TRUE,"I am hopeing the good news train stays put for me . Wednesday I am having an ultra sound of my thyroid because of nodules seen there on CT and the following Monday they are doing a bronchoscopy of my right lung because of 4 pea sized nodules found on same Ct in there . No one is saying mets but everyone wants to know what they are . If no cancer in my past 90 % of thyroid nodules are B9 . Stats fall to about 70 since a previous cancer . Still not bad odds . The lung could be something from my past since I never had a CT before . No one knows if they were there previously or not . During the bronchoscopy they will try to biopsy the largest nodule 7mm and also wash the lung and suction out the saline and check it for abnormal cells of any kind . If any question they will send to Mayos . The bronchoscopy is done with the same kind of meds as a colonoscopy so you don ; t remember a thing . Still 7 more days of rads left . I am in middle of boosts . 3 this coming week because machine down on Friday and 4 the following . Bronchoscopy on Monday and rads Tues thru Friday and I will be done !! If all tests b9 nothing but pills , checkups and herceptin every 3 weeks till March ahead . Keep me in your prayers . Annette "
2,TRUE,"Hi ladies , I had neoadjuvant chemo . Last year , Herceptin , Carboplatinin & Taxol . I had a nasty allergic reaction to Taxol , so we changed to Abraxane & that went very well for me . After 3 rounds they learned my Her2 diagnosis was incorrect & changed it to negative . Then we followed with 2 more Abraxane only . I also had 1 pos . node via needle biopsy . Then went to British Virgin Islands for vacation !!! Then had lumpectomy with SNBiospy . Surgeon took 3 nodes & all were negative . Some chemo must have done it ! Also , my tumor shrank about 50 % . I understand prognosis generally improves with response to chemo , and the more the better . After lumpectomy in Jan. , I JUST FINISHED last chemo hooray . This time I had TAC -LRB- In my case Abraxane for the T -RRB- , Adriamycin & Cytoxan . Toward the end of this regimen I became moody -- or more , teary . I spoke to a buddy survivor who said she fell apart while taking AC . MARIA from Jersey , are you on AC ? I believe all the side effects are ours - but just for a little while . We get to be finished with it - and hopefully , expectantly , NEVER do it again ! So you can do it and then you 'll be done ! Sending the light of health to you all . "

2,TRUE,"Hi Wherria -- I also have thought about how I will handle the hair thing . Originally , I thought that I would cut my shoulder length hair short and then shave -- at one point I was thinking that I would be OK with no wig -- but , I do want a wig . I went to the wig shop via the hospital and got talking to the person and it does n't make sense for me to have a hair cut and then go about it dropping out , shaving then wearing the wig . I thought that probably after or just before the first treatment , I will go to wig shop -- they will shave my hair `` GI Jane special '' and I can then just start with the wig . This seems to work for me -- right now . I have n't started chemo yet -- will probably start in a couple of weeks when surgeon gives green light . "
0,TRUE,"Well chemo went smoothly yesterday , it started with back massage and 3mg of morphine for the pain in my hip so that I could sit in the chair for 4 hours . It was pretty much a blurr for the rest of the day . I am upset that I have to stop the tykerb until further notice . I even called them again today and tried to get a better reason out of him for stopping it , he just does not want me on it right now . I asked about the herceptin and he just wants to talk about it later on down the road . he says I am on the old fashion chemo and it is better this way , it says it might work and it might not work , I want my NP she has seen me for pretty much the past 3 years and this is only the 2nd time I have had the doctor . My NP is so up beat and she gives me hope and I think that is the best way to be with a patient facing this . We all no the risks , but a doctor should not have to rub them in our faces with out at least getting the results after the first round of chemo . Well I have eaten about everything in the house , I am sending hubby to the store to stock up for the night , I forgot about the hunger from the steroids . I am only taking zofran for antinausea so I guess the steroids are still in me form yesterday .

5,TRUE,"Hi Christine , It is a bit shocking to see the scar for the first time . I was not prepared at all to look down at 70 staples . There were n't pictures for me to see or anyone I knew who had been through it , so I was sort of surprised . I wrote in my journal that day how my surgeon must have been employed at a railroad previously , since it looked like he got confused and laid train tracks across my chest , lol now . But it was n't so lol then to me . The good news is that healing happens and the drains come out and then it starts to be better . My 12 yr old son was horrified that I had to have my breasts `` amputated '' as he put it . We told the kids what was going on from the start but we were careful to give them only the facts as they could handle them . I had my meltdowns when no one was home and kept a brave face for the kids . Some people may not agree with that but I felt it was important that my bc not be the focal point of their childhood . I also could not think about recon then but now am . "
4,TRUE,"Hey everyone ! What a crazy ride , huh ? I had a lumpectomy a week ago . Pathology report came back as the cancer being way , way bigger than they had thought . Thus , I will be having a masectomy next Friday . I am trying to decide as many of you have , if I should get a single or a double . I have read the pros and cons to each that have been posted on this site , and what an amazing site this is :-RRB- Here is my question to everyone - If you chose to do only a unilateral , are you happy with your decision ? Does the other breast look anything like the reconstructed breast ? If you chose to do bilateral , are you happy you made that decision -LRB- given that the choice was yours to make -RRB- ? Had an MRI yesterday of both breasts and there is an area in question on my right breast that I will be having a biopsy on Wednesday for . My decision may be made for me already , but I 'm still needing to hear from all my `` breast friends '' ... "
6,TRUE,I am in the same boat . Trying to convince my doc to put me on Zometa . I finished chemo and rad in May of 08 . Just trying to stay ontop of treatment options and new things on the horizon .

6,TRUE,"Hey Sue , honey , none of us is brave , strong , anything . If I feel a funny pain I turn into a weeping hunk of junk in about 10 seconds . We all do . I doubt very much if this little thingy is anything , but since you are going in , be sure and have someone look at it . And for goodness sake , stop apologizing for being terrified , we were and often still are , terrified . You need to be able to be perfectly open and honest here , this is your safe place . You will have things , and fears for quite some time with every little thing that happens to you . I went to the dentist about a year after my cancer to get a tooth checked . He always does a mouth `` feel '' around too . He looked at me and said , `` Did you know you have a lump in your tongue ? '' . I almost had a heart attack on the spot . I was completely terrified . I think I scared him . He took it out , sewed my tongue back up and , of course , this was on a Friday , no labs open . Soooo , what a fun weekend I had . Then , he called and told me on Monday it was just a silly lump . I must have died a thousand times of fright . I could n't sleep , eat -LRB- altho that did n't hurt me any -RRB- or even move around well . I felt like I was in a fog . I do n't like you thinking you are with a bunch of amazons . We are not . Trust me , you are just as brave , just as strong . And I fell apart like a handful of Pick-Up-Stix when he said `` lump '' . So talk about anything , you must know we are in exactly the same boat . I get a back ache and it is mets . I have had toe mets , mets of the hair follicles , you name it . Never just a headache , always a brain tumor . I do n't want to scare you more , but you need to know that you are just as strong and brave as any of us . We are just a little further down the road . Of course you worry about the little `` thingys '' , anyone would . So yell loudly and find out what it is . So keep on keeping on , sweetie , one step , one day at a time . You will get there .

4,TRUE,"Hi Kathy , I 'm not sure what to tell you about the `` pain '' you are feeling . If it 's small , has positive receptors , and you are under treatment it seems to me it 's time to take a deep breath and chill until you 've got more of a handle on what is needed beyond surgery . Lumpectomy , radiation , and endocrine therapy seem like the givens right now , based on what you 've said . After the surgery your tumor will give you more information and you and your doctors can take it from there . The emotional roller coaster is way out of your control , you know . You are along for the ride . Just try not to be afraid of your feelings , let them come . Mine were all over the place . This is normal . You are normal . Do n't worry too much about preparing yourself , you will be up to the challenge , I know it . "

2,TRUE,"I agree with blue . We are all different . I even read a post awhile back on this site that one woman considered herself 100 % cured . Think how hard it must be to deal with this in the public light ? People constantly asking questions wanting to know every little thing . Yes , she is a celebrity but that does n't mean we own her or her feelings . She is probably coping the best way she can . Her mother has also battled breast cancer . And a double mastectomy may have been a devastating decision for her as it is most women . She is still a B/C sister . She might even be lurking somewhere on these boards . Even if she is not handling her situation the way some of us feel she should be handling it lets not be so hard on the woman . And let 's not forget the media twists things , maybe Christina is trying to put on a happy face but maybe its her way of getting through it . Also , she is not responsible for the way people think .

The rollercoaster ride continues .
4,TRUE,"With CMF treatment complete hair loss is rare -LRB- I still dont know why -RRB- ... . . but hair will fall out . You will have thinning of your hair . I took anit-nausea when I felt nausea , and would never leave my house without it . It kind of felt like being car sick to me , or on a spinning amusement park ride , it would come in waves . I became menopausal . I had low wbc counts almost every time I went back to the cancer hospital and had to wait 1 week to retest before I was allowed next treatment . -LRB- I was initially put on a high dose which was reduced slightly for 2nd round - that is , the round after radiation if my memory serves me right , reason my chemo oncologist said I did not tolerate high doses well -RRB- . There are chemo treatments where hair loss is going to happen , but it always grows back after treatment is finished . "

0,TRUE,Libby -- Keep your chin up ! It took an excisional biopsy and 3 reexcisions to clear my margins . Ten weeks of feeling like a crazy person and always doubting the decision between lumpectomy or mastectomy . My surgeon stated that the NCI okays 3 lumpectomies before mastectomy is n't a choice . After much thought and tears -- I decided to try one last time before mast -- now we are clear and getting ready for rads . This is a hard road we travel -- I wish you and all of us traveling this road well and God Bless -- Nancy

6,TRUE,"Hi , I dont have any answers for you seeing I am in the same boat . Just found out DCIS stage 3 Condo . Still trying to decide between Lump and Mast . My `` area '' could be 6 x 25x .03 cm so they are pushing me towards Mast . But that seems so drastic for something that MAY turn to cancer some day . Reading your entry - makes me feel like the Mast is the way to go to just do it and get it over with . Also leaning towards reconstruction at the same time . So , your story has just helped me .

2,TRUE,"Oh , sweetie !! The worst is not knowing . I am 1 month post-op , and all I can tell you is when you go through the tests before surgery , is ask for Xanax !!! My doctor prescribed one pill before my MRI , and I thought , `` Why did n't they think of this before all the other tests ? '' It was so bearable - I did n't even cry -LRB- which is what I was doing every second of the day !! -RRB- It was an hour and 15 minutes !!! After that , because I could n't stop crying , I called my general practitioner -LRB- because my surgeon said he did n't know me well enough to prescribe -RRB- and told him the situation , he called in a prescription . It was the best thing I did . It really helped me through all the testing -LRB- which was quite extensive -RRB- , and it helped me before surgery -LRB- double mastectomy with expanders -RRB- . It was approved by the anesthesiologist . My husband and I just talked and laughed -LRB- can you imagine ??? -RRB- There is a light at the tunnel - just hang in there .

2,FALSE,"Hi , everyone . Just joined this network and would like to seek some advice from those who have heard about/used the subject product . I suffered from breast cancer in late 1991 and thank God for carrying me through , being a suvivor until now . I had undergone mastectomy , radiotherapy and chemotherapy in late 1991 until mid 1992 .

The lymphedema treatment and support is not very sufficient in Hong Kong and so I always watch out the development in other countries . Currently , I 'm doing sort of manual lymph drainage and some self massage , wearing a compression garment . I have recently been introduced to the use of Bioptron light -LRB- http://www.lymph.com.au/category4_1.htm -RRB- . They claim that the light can stimulate light-sensitive intracellular structures and moleculesm . This then initiates cellular chain reactions which in turn helps reduce the swelling . As it is quite expensive , I want to know more before hiring or buying one . I would welcome the views from those who have tried it . Many thanks ~ Tweety . "
4,TRUE,"TRICIA - I think most of us on here can relate to your feelings right now as we have all been through or are still experiencing this roller coaster of a ride . You need to give yourself credit for being a strong woman which you are and you will make it through this . I always refer to a Christmas cartoon in my posts , one that my kids -LRB- now 13 and 15 -RRB- used to watch . There is a song in it that has a line : keep putting one foot in front of the other and soon you 'll be walking out the door . That line has taken on new meaning for me through this bc journey - just keep doing that and taking each day as it comes and you WILL get to the other side . I am now finished with chemo -LRB- middle of July -RRB- , have about 1/1/2 '' of hair and have had my recon surgery . I spent three hours this morning writing a 3 page letter to my family and friends chronicling this past year for me . I sat in front of the computer with tears streaming down my face as I remembered each and every event that I have made it through this year . YOU WILL MAKE IT THROUGH TOO !!! No doubt it is a long and trying road but know that some time before you know it you will be looking back on your travels too and lending supportive words to someone else who needs it . I hope with all my heart that this journey will soon end for all women , but , until it does we will be hear for each other . I am always around to lend an ear , if you 'd like to PM me , I 'd be happy to chat , until then ... HUGS , Dawn "
0,TRUE,"I was a grade three and my onco score was an 18 . I did not do chemo . After weighing all the risk of the chemo my ocologist told me to go home and forget chemo . He said the benefit I would get from the chemo would not really outweight the side effects and the things that could happen doing the chemo . I was a stage one not 2A and I went along with my doctors suggestions . I did not cherish the idea of chemo . I knew people a few years down the road who ended up with heart problems from their chemo . I did lumpectomy and radiation and doing these horrible pills , femara , and everyday I say I am not taking them anymore as they have been as bad or worse then chemo on me . I still say there are people who do chemo and people who do n't and they both have recurrences . I was 58 at the time of diagnosis though also . This is a decision each individual must make and live with and anything can happen no matter which way you decide ... . . jude14 "
0,TRUE,"I had a right mastectomy 10 years ago at age 43 . DCIS - no radiation , chemo or tamoxifen . Thought I was done This last sumer I started having more back and leg pain . I attributed this to my active lifestyle . I went into menopause at age 46 . Went to PT had a chest x-ray because of rib pain and they missed a compression fracture at T-9 . I would get better and then get worse . I had a hysterectomy with BSO for repeated abnormal PAPs , history of personal cancer and grandmother with ovarian cancer . -LRB- They missed the compression fracture again on preop x-ray -RRB- No cancer in this path . Back was n't better so went for MRI . Found compression fracture . Went to oncolgist . ad CT scans , bone scans , enzymes - all looked good -LRB- except the bone scan did n't get read right away -RRB- . I went to see if a vertebroplasty could help but the interventional radiologist said the injury was too chronic . They did a biopsy and found metastatic adenocarcinoma - estrogen positive , herceptin negative . To top it off I have a new primary DCIS in the left breast . The bone mets seems limited to the t-9 area and my trochantar . Unfortunately the area in the hip fractured this week -LRB- horrible pain -RRB- and I now have metal rod and some pins . Good news is I am finally getting mobile , I was only in two days and the procedure is so much simpler than in years past . My oncologist was upset with himself for not acting to stabilize the hip earlier but I am not sure he was aware or that I would have been so open to it at that point . The up side is that I out of major pain and on the road to getting back to work and `` normal '' . I will have an mastectomy on the left in the next few weeks . A plastic 's doc I consulted a year or so ago about revising the right reconstruction said he thought I had breast tissue on the right still so I plan to have them start from scratch and do both but for me the mastectomies and reconstruction are the way I want to go . I will probably have to have surgery on the compression fracture so it will be a big year . I am on Femera , Zometa and will finish radiation to the spine in the next week or so.I am encouraged overall and realize that I have been given a chance to know what really is important and to enjoy everyday . I have asked for PET scan and a close look again at the bone scan . Knowing what I am dealing with is the biggest part of the battle . It is comforting to read the posts and know I am not alone out there . "

My oncologist did n't say anything about it , though , nor did the radiologist . I agree with you , I assume the radiation would take care of anything that may have escaped beyond the narrow margin into the chest wall . I do n't think I would want anyone to cut into the chest wall - I imagine that could potentially cause some discomfort forever . Actually , I would think that not only would the radiation get it , but would n't the chemotherapy as well ? I 'll be interested in hearing what your surgeon has to say . Please keep us posted .

I am glad to be alive of course , and my yoga practice helps me a lot , but damn ... . it seems quite unfair . First having both breasts removed . Reconstruction that is sort of OK but not all that attractive really . Working is hard . Actually I have a difficult time getting myself motivated . I thought I could be a bright shining light to help others , but at this point , I am the one still reaching out for help . It sucks . "
5,TRUE,"Hi everyone , I wrote a long post , then lost it in cyberspace . Darn ... Fotopet , Day , Hang in there , I think we all have difficult days and weeks and it is hard not to let the depression sink in . It seems like an eternity since all this started and I am only 2 down , 14 more to go , plus radiation ... I live alone but my significant other comes every two weeks and stays through my chemo . He lives 110 miles away and has a house , yard and etc to care for . So being alone is tough . Leanna , my onc said walking was the best exercise , but I think running , if you are up for it , would also work . Exercise is so important for healing the body and keeping us strong . I have days where I am too weak , and I just wait till a day I can go . For me , although I love running , I could not have my tummy bounces so much right now . My new S/E for the day is a dripping bladder , no burning or fever , just a slow drip . Yikes . This does n't allow for a lot self respect . Ha . Sacphotomom , I love my prothesis . My clothes look normal , but more important , the weight feels normal . For walking , around the house , etc , I wear my camisole , which is very lop sided , due to my MB -LRB- mature breasts -RRB- but it is comfortable . Yesterday , I bought Dr. Brommers pure castile citris orange soap and love to scrub head to toes with it . I think castile soap is very gentle and we need that now . Take care and be gentle with yourself . This too will end , and we must think of the future and all the things we want for our life , family , etc. . My yard is so overgrown . Yikes . I love to walk out back as it is wooded , even though I live `` in town '' , a small college town . I too am too tired for gardening , my energy comes and goes like a freight train blowing through town . Best wishes and hugs to all . "
2,TRUE,"I , too , suffer from rippling in both breasts . I am thin skinned as well as lean and have not been happy with my reconstruction . I have Inamed medium profile silicone implants . My PS was baffled at how I still rippled even with the the Alloderm . I contemplated a revision to high profile implants but do n't know if I want to go through another surgery ... . and for that matter whether the rippling would be corrected . I will see him again in June and will discuss further , but for right now , I do not want to risk anything worse from any revision . In a bra , the breast mounds look good , although I also have some hollowness in the upper pole area of the breast where the breast tissue once was . BTW , I had total skin and nipple sparing mastectomy . Take care and sending you healing light . "

I may decide I do n't want to go through another recovery . I am doing ok with my prosthesis for the time being . We 'll see about a little further down the road how I feel about it then . Good luck . Keep us posted how you are doing and if you have any other questions we can help with , ask away ! "

The best news though was that when my sis went back to the doc fully expecting to be put on a new chemo drug , he said that the tumors were not growing so no chemo for now ! We decided fancy vacations are a good treatment for cancer . As for me ... the one with bc . I had my ct scan for the nodule on Tuesday and meet with the onc on Monday . Hate the waiting .

However I am afraid of an embarrassing recurrence & the on-call dr. wanted me to head for the ER immediately so that dehydration would n't occur . Instead I 'm drinking constantly a little at a time . I almost wish that food still tasted strange so that I would n't have to work so hard at resisting standing rib road .

Some people make light of it to make them seem less toxic than they are . I 've heard chemo referred to as magic juice and scrubbing bubbles . I do n't want to live with permanent side effects from chemo . It might be easier from some , but I am alone without support from my family and I do n't have but a few friends . And of course they try and rush you into each treatment . I waited 2 months before I had my surgery and I 'm glad I did . I learned a lot . As far as chemo goes I feel I 'm damned if I do damned if I do n't . It sounds like you 're feeling the same way . I have a friend who is getting chemo . She 's happy with her choice .

0,FALSE,"Well , as of Friday I 'm off again for 2 weeks - certainly not handling this stuff well . I 'm the 2nd Canadian patient and seem to be the only one of the 4 from our centre on the actual drug - based on SE 's . Apparently there are less than 400 people participating so far worldwide so they 're still at the very beginning of this final phase trial . I 'm certainly not handling the stuff well at all - going to my second dose reduction and so far the diarrhea , fatigue and nausea have knocked me flat . Even with the chemo the anti nausea drugs worked better than with this drug . I take Gravol but I 'm sure it 's contributing to the ` ca n't keep my eyes open ' fatigue ... pretty rough when working f/t in a pretty stressful job that keeps me on the road a lot . So I 'm going down to 160 next and we 'll see how that works . Going to try staying on the Lomotil as well as the Iimodium and move to Stemetil for the nausea so I can give up the Gravol . They told me 120 is as low as I can go and stay in the trial . As my husband says , and in my positive moments I agree - better to feel like crap for a year and live another 30 . Tough to rationalize though when I have to leave meetings to sit on the porcelain bus , do n't have the energy to have fun with my terrific little grandkids and feel like I 'm either going to faint or throw up most of the time ... whining finished ...

6,TRUE,"Plainjane , I 'm in the exact same boat as you . I felt like crap years before my bc diagnosis , and in fact felt so bad that I knew I had cancer -- I just did n't know where . So when I found the lump , it was n't a big surprise . Of course , the docs all poo-pooed the notion that my fatigue/malaise/low-grade fevers were cancer related . After chemo and rads , I actually started to feel better , but now that I 'm 7 months out from rads and 9 months out from chemo , I 'm starting to feel sick again . I do n't think it 's the tamoxifen , b/c those side effects have been different for me . I had a CT and mammo in July , and a breast MRI last January , and everything was fine , as was my blood work in July . But since the mammo missed my ILC the first time around , and ILC is so hard to see on CT , I 'm not 100 % convinced there 's nothing there .

0,TRUE,I was a 36 B almost C before all this . The first lumpectomy I thought was OK without reconstruction . I could have lived with it . Except they got the IDC out with good margins but found ILC in the margins . Went back for another lumpectomy and there was more ILC and DLCS . So there goes that boob . I decided I could not do this again and ILC is so likely to show up in the other one down the road I did a double with immediate TE reconstruction . It has made the chemo harder but I will be done -LRB- I hope -RRB- months sonner . Like June 1st I 'm thinking I 'm out of treatment . No radiation because both nodes sides were negatiove.I guess I 'd rather be down harder than longer . What choices we have !
2,FALSE,"YES ! I 'm past the 75 % mark for chemo ! Had # 3 yesterday , so today is blah . But I only have ONE left ! Chemo is doable ... but oh my God , it is NOT fun at ALL .

Yeah , the whole BRCA thing was just so ludicrous ... all my doctors were just amazed at my insurances ' denial . The reason my Dad got tested so easily is because he 's a man with breast cancer ... he did n't need to have a family history ... and Medicare paid for it .

In the mean time , enjoy the New Year knowing we are all hoping for Negative Nodes . Kathy-To answer your question about why take everything . I too am premenopausal , but apparently , with ovaries out to knock out any potential creation of estrogen , the meds I 'd take after chemo and rads would be for post menopausal women , and it has the slight potential of encouraging uterin cancer , so I thought why keep any of it if I no longer need it ? Wow , a family of teachers . You went into a service position , too , and one like teachers that is n't often recognized as a ` real ' profession . So , I will raise a glass to nurses and teachers tonight ... BRAVO !!!! Arkansas Deb - I do n't recall seeing you here before ... I could be wrong ... but welcome . We have a teacher at school who lost her hair to a weird autoimmune thing , too . Would n't that be a hoot if chemo had the opposite effect on you since you 've already lost your hair ... kind of like stimulants given to ADHD kids have the opposite affect-calms them down ... but speeds others up . Speaking of which , D1 and LJ13 , I 'm sorry that you 're just buzzing and fidgety ... I heard the steroids can have that affect . Glad things are moving along , in more ways than one LJ13 . God I hope the smell of coffee does n't double me over ... I love coffee . I wrote a poem earlier today and wanted to share my New Years Wish with you all . After much rain , the sun is shining on this final day of twenty-07 , and I think of the many dear ones watching over us from heaven . Massive pearly gates and golden-winged angels is n't exactly what I imagine this place , but rather where souls give dissertations , accounting for their time in this Earthbound space . I imagine much hearty laughter as they recognize their many mistakes , and the futile agonizing they 'd done causing their hearts to physically ache . I try to listen for my loved ones messages , but sometimes the mundane gets in the way screaming over their persistent whispers , making it difficult to hear all they have to say . The message that always comes through though , no matter how loud the man-made clatter , is the truth that we are all of one human race , and acting with love is all that matters . It matters not what religion we hold dear , nor what political party we call our own , for we can all agree we bleed the same , and will reap what we each have sown . So as I go into this newest of years , that message kept near to my heart . I will aspire to treat all with love , knowing of this universe , we are all a part . HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!! LET US ALL ASPIRE TO MAKE 2008 MORE THAN GREAT !!!! SIS Kimberly "

I was diagnosed with dcis in june I had a mastectomy with a pedicle flap reconstruction at the same time . From the time of the diagnosis to the surgery was a month my dcis was a high grade II , after the surgery i have had some complications 2 weeks after i got home from the hospital I had the abdominal incision opened up as i have fat necrosis and has to be packed 2 to 4 times a day it was about 2 inches opened then about 2 weeks ago the same thing happened with the my left breast -LRB- flap -RRB- now this has to be packed twice a day until it closes up too i was just wondering if anyone has had the same problems too . my ps said that 20 % of women have this problem , I feel like this is never going to end i 've been off work since the surgeryas the abdominal incision is as solid as a rock which cause severe pain when doing any type bending , my flap constantly swells on the side where they took the breast some much that i ca n't put my arm at my side .

5,TRUE,"Hi Minxie . I think we can all understand where you are coming from and , at least for me , it depends on the day if I feel this way or not . I can tell you that I have gone through counseling almost since the time I was diagnosed and it does help to make an appointment when I feel the worries and the anger creep in . Post traumatic stress is real and it is so difficult to deal with when active treatment ends especially if you are triple neg . I am sure the posters on the triple neg forum will have lots of love to give you on that . I just wanted you to know that check ups are not `` all or nothing '' and you can find that happy medium between you and your onc . My onc is young and great and told me that he does not do tumor markers at all . He said if I insist he will do them but does not feel that they are reliable enough for all of the anxiety they produce . I am good with that but I am probably going to insist on a scan here or there but that is just me . It sounds like a lot of your medical decisions had to be changed quickly without you really getting a a chance to get your mind around them and be comfortable . My big surprise came when they found invasive cancer in the other breast as well but I had already decided that I wanted a BMX so other than feeling like I was on a speeding , out of control cancer train it did not change my treatment decisions . I had already made peace with the surgery and it sounds like you never got that chance . I am sorry for all that you have been through and I just have to believe that better days are ahead . Wonderful days with your kids where cancer was just a blip on your life radar .

0,TRUE,and were the margins clear this time ? That can play a factor in the decision to have rads or not down the road ...
0,TRUE,"Good to hear that you are having a PET/CT before finishing rads . Just a word of advice . For well over two years , every time I had a PET/CT or a PET I was told simply to fast the day of the scan . In September I went to a different facility . They told me to refrain from any carbs , sugar , dairy -LRB- except for hard cheese -RRB- and to avoid chewing gum and exercise for a full 24 hours before the day of the test . Since then I 've spoken to some other oncologists who also have their patients do same . All feel you get a cleaner , more reliable read . ???? Check out your facility . See what they require . And most of all , best of luck that you are finally on the road to recovery ! "
0,TRUE,"Mena , Well you do n't know me either , but so many know you and post about you , that I joined in to see who this wonderful gal was ! You have a lot of supporters all over the world , which says a lot of good about you . I 'm real sorry to hear you 're hurting from your lung mets . I see that you get bothered by shoulder pain . It 's always tricky to work on pain reduction in a patient with lung problems , as most narcotic pain meds affect the respiratory center . But there are many newer agents , some non-narcotic , so I do hope you might see a palliative care specialist or pain management specialist . Palliative care specialists are a relatively new on the field : there goal as physicians and nurses are to offer help in all aspects of treatment -LRB- not treatment withdrawal -RRB- as I understand it . I do n't know if you are in the US or what , but they are trying to raise their flags to be sought out in difficult situations such as yours . One question that is very important is how recent is your biopsy on your tumor ? I 've posted a lot on this , as it is clear that while most tumors recur the same , there are exceptions to this up to 20 % or the time or so . I 'm sure your oncologist has discussed this with you , or feels it 's been close enough , since she is prescribing Aromasin now . Mena , are you taking your Aromasin with some fat , like low fat milk , or yogurt ? Since it 's a steroid , it gets absorbed better with some fat in your stomach as you take it . But , sounds like it 's getting absorbed , as I think that 's why your nausea . If you ever took the Pill , well it 's the same feeling the first week -LRB- s -RRB- or so . Probably stimulates the nausea center in the brain . Might even ask your onc for some mild antinausea medicine , although you should accommodate to it with time . I read that you tried Falsodex : newer evidence is mounting that higher doses may be needed than originally thought . Particularly of significance if one is moved off of Falsodex because tumor markers are rising . Turns out that even with hormonals , just like chemotherapy , the lysis or death of cells can cause a transient -LRB- not persistent -RRB- rise in markers so it takes a knowledgeable and open-minded oncologist and patient to deal with those hormone cards . So perhaps this drug might be re-visited down the road by your oncologist . Rarely , a patient who is ER/PR + might be given Megestrol . It 's an old fashioned hormone , but yet does work with ER + breast cancer . It is associated with some weight gain ; regrettably it 's not muscle gain . But surprisely , in some situations it brings a good response . Hormones are sometimes recylable too . Oh , there 's so much to say , but the bottom line is we get tired , even of hearing of `` potentials '' . I join the others in saying , we 've been rooting for you , will continue to do so , and are very willing to post when you need us . I 'll keep you and your little girl close , Mena , in my prayers at night . I hate to see you suffer , and hope some re-addressing of sleep meds , pain addressing , and nutrition may be offered to you . Thanks for your honesty , your telling it like it is , and even for asking for a hand ... It shows to me you wish to keep on fighting , and have an open mind . All the best , Tender "

4,FALSE,"Viv - Glad to hear your surgery went well . Just be careful not to push yourself too hard ! Suemed - Please let us know how you 're doing ! Beachmom & others - Best of luck for successful surgeries & smooth recoveries ! I had my post-op appt with the surgeon this morning -LRB- wide lumpectomy & ALND a week ago -RRB- . He took the drain out , even though I 'd still been draining > 30cc/day . I may need to go get fluid aspirated if it builds up ; we 'll see how that goes . I do n't seem to have any numbness or tingling , just a dull achy feeling in the armpit area . I 'm gradually improving my reach with that arm . I got a mixed bag on the pathology report , mostly good I guess . The margins around the tumor were clear . The surgeon also took some add ' l `` slices '' of tissue beyond the tumor margins , which is a good thing , because one of those `` slices '' showed some `` islands '' of cancer cells separate from the tumor , which means I 've got to go back for re-excision . The `` islands '' had been located closer to the chest wall cavity . So while it 's bad news that there 's more cancer in there , I 'm trying to view it as good news that we seem to have caught it early . If the re-excision does n't provide clear margins , I might be facing a full mastectomy , but right now I 'm taking it one step at a time . -LRB- I already had bone & CT scans , which came back clean . -RRB- He cleared me to drive , so at least I 'm not stuck in the house , but I 'm not cleared to go back to work til sometime after the next surgery -LRB- which w/probably be the week of 3/31 -RRB- . Also , I 'm very glad that I opted to go for the ALND rather than SNB , as I had one or 2 enlarged nodes , with a large grade 3 tumor . It turns out that 1 of the 19 nodes was cancerous , so now I 'd first be facing that surgery , too , rather than having it behind me . -LRB- They 're taking a second look at the nodes because they think they might have been looking at two nodes as if they were one , so maybe it 's 2 positive nodes out of 20 , or something along that line . Still low ! -RRB- One thing that 's really helped keep my spirits up is my knitting , both as a creative pastime & in the friends I 've made in my knitting groups , both `` real-world '' -LRB- local , meet weekly -RRB- , and virtual , in an online knit - & - crochet community with members around the world . I posted a thread last week , a couple of days before my surgery , that I needed hugs , & within minutes I had a couple dozen responses , over 100 the next day .

Some of the women in my local group have given my & / or my daughter rides this past week , & several are planning to cook for us while I 'm on chemo . -LRB- I would n't be surprised if they knit me some chemo caps , too . -RRB- Keeping all of you in my thoughts !

I had a very very small tumor -LRB- 6mm -RRB- but grade 3 . They did not think I would need chemo but score showed something different . So with Chemo and hormones my risk becomes significantly lower . Onco says chemo will really help to ensure that I stay in the good cancer boat as he called it . Only you can decided what to do .

2,TRUE,"Hi Zeamer3 - Spotted that you had posted earlier and thought I 'd pick your brains if you do n't mind . I gave my views in earlier posts as to my reasons for having radiotherapy and agree that we all have to reach our own decisions based on the merits of our own breast cancer and weighing up the advice of our medics with our own research . . My question - I read an article from a few years ago saying that early research had been done into a test for telling which patients with early breast cancers would most likely suffer from long-term side-effects of rads and could put that into consideration when deciding on rads/no rads for early breast cancers . The article also stated that anti-oxidants helped to prevent breast fibrosis developing . Could all that green tea , dark chocolate and tomatoes I have been consuming since diagnosis actually be doing more good than I thought it was ! The fruit they talked about was green grapes and they were giving extracts to a control group in the form of tablets and another group were having a placebo . Can you shed any light on this .

I would much rather finish what we 've started now than to have to start all over again somewhere down the road ! So , if I must have radiation , bleh , but I 'll do it .

I find it hard to tell people . Yesterday I picked up the paper and there was a story in the parade section of the paper of a Dr. who had cancer . Then people visiting next door came over and I could n't believe it ... the wife just got out of Chemo . I got to sit with her and talk how it has been with her . . Then I came in for some lunch and turned on the TV and Michael Keaton 's movie , `` Life '' was on about his terminal cancer and recording his life . Is seems like now Cancer is all around me . . did I not notice it before ? Amazing . Thank you again my new friends ... Brenda "

After the skin started to peal , similar to any 3rd degree burn , the pain seemed to lesten . Probably somewhat mental because it did n't look so bad ! The pains under the arm and at the incision he said was due to the nerve endings being radiated and reacting - which seemed to lessen in time . It 's hard to say but the time really went by fast !

0,TRUE,"I have just gone through the difficult process of deciding lumpectomy vs mastectomy myself . For me it was perhaps the hardest part of the whole process . I spent weeks researching and talking with others about what would be best . To me it seemed lumpectomy with radiation followed by tamoxiphen seemed to be the overwhelming `` thing to do '' on these boards and even by some of the doctors I consulted . After all I was told I had only a very small area of dcis and that was only in my left breast . It seemed everyone was saying the same thing , lumpectomy with radiation had the same survival outcome as mastectomy . Especially when you add tamoxiphen to the mix . In the end I had bilateral mastectomy and here was my reasoning and conclusions . First survival rates and recurrence rates are two different things . Mastectomies gave the lowest risk of recurrence obviously . Lumpectomy even with radiation had a significantly higher risk for recurrence and as my surgeon said . Dcis is a sneaky thing . It can sometimes be in more places than original known , it can be more extensive than originally thought -LRB- since it travels through the duct system -RRB- and if and when it recurs it can be as dcis or as invasive . At that point its a whole new ballgame . For now there are no perfect tests to 100 % tell you exactly what is hiding in those breasts . Only on the final pathology can you know that . Many women here can testify to additional areas of dcis or invasive being found on the final pathology that no one knew existed . You can also not be on this site long before you see how many tests miss cancers that are already known to be there . Mri 's , mammograms , ultrasound etc. are not 100 % perfect tests at knowing whats there especially in women who have dense breast tissue . My surgeon also said many doctors just are n't sure how to treat dcis . Some dcis may never break through and become invasive while others do . What makes some dcis change and become invasive ? They know that in mice it does happen sometimes in a span of months but are not sure what causes the change . Also some women can have a large amount of dcis and no invasion . Others can have a small amount of dcis and have microinvasion or invasion . Anytime you have invasion you can have the potential for metastasis . Plus since my dcis was in my left breast it would mean having radiation so that was another whole area of researching . Each treatment for cancer has its own set of side effects . Radiation is never 100 % safe either . The statistics look pretty good for awhile out but now they are starting to see the cardiac side effects down the road . Radiation can damage the blood vessels that run close to the chest wall . Newer technology helps to protect the lung and heart but there is no one who can guarantee 100 % that no part of the heart/and or lungs will go unaffected by the radiation scatter . So women who do the radiation need to know there can be a chance that they may develop heart or lung problems later in life from the radiation treatment they had from breast cancer . Only time will show how significant these issues will be from todays radiation techniques . Even taking the tamoxiphen will have its side effects . Some will tolerate it well others wo n't . So at the end of all this research I came to these conclusions for myself . With breast cancer there are no absolute guarantees , no perfect doctors , no perfect tests and no one solution for everyone . Doctors try to help what they can , women try to choose the best they can , and the treatments we have now try to find and cure cancer the best they can . In the end my pathology came back that there was only the tiny area of dcis in my left breast , no surprises there . However my `` good breast '' the one taken off prophylactically came back with cell changes that put me at a higher risk for developing cancer in that breast at a future date . Something I did n't want to have to deal with again . But even if it had n't come back that way for me the bilateral was the right decision because I did n't want the additional risks associated with the radiation or the tamoxiphen . I do want to add that if mine had been invasive then those risks would have been ones I would readily have taken on in order to fight the breast cancer . No one wants to take radiation or chemo but if those are the only tools one has to fight with then thats what you have to do till they come up with something better . And yes even bilateral mastectomy is not 100 % guarantee that cancer will not come back because there is no guarantee that every breast cell is taken out during a mastectomy , but it has been and still is the best option they have out there with the lowest risk of recurrence . I 'd encourage anyone at this decision point to google recurrence rates for each treatment currently available . Go back to the original articles everyone likes to quote and see for yourself what they have to say . My prayer is that they will find a cure so no one else will have to make these agonizing decisions . "
0,TRUE,"And you really ought to have a port because you have such a long road to go , and it is standard these days . Definitely , the staff should be more accomodating . I 'm not 100 % happy with my gynological oncologist and his staff for my endocervical cancer . But with the breast cancer I have to do chemo , so I better like the doctor , the nurses , and the ambiance . The office is beautiful . The nurses are kind , well-informed , and prompt w/calls etc. . And the doctor seems pretty stellar to me . You need the same . "
0,TRUE,I had bilat . mastectomies and on the advice of my plastic surgeon and radiation oncologist decided to wait on any type of reconstruction until after radiation . So now that I 'm done with radiation I 'd really like to avoid another big surgery -LRB- meaning a flap type surgery -RRB- and just do expanders/implants . Has anyone had reconstruction done this way ? Did you have any complications immediately ... down the road ? Thank you for any input !
2,TRUE,"I was diagnosed with a recurrence in December . My first diagnosis was almost 13 years ago -LRB- lumpectomy , lymphectomy , radiation , Tamoxifen for 5 years -RRB- . The lump that was found this time was under the arm that had previous lymphectomy and radiation . I am scheduled for surgery on March 25th . Due to the location of the lump , they will be removing a fairly large amount of skin and flesh from my torso and doing an LD flap reconstruction on my trunk to enable me to maintain use of my arm . My surgeons can give me no prior examples of this and after weeks of internet searching , I can find NOTHING about this type of reconstruction . I posted previously in the surgery thread and no one seems to have any info . Is there anyone out there who can shed some light on what I can expect with this particular surgery ? Or , am I truly going `` where no one has gone before '' ? "
4,TRUE,"I 'm a triple negative that has tested positive for both BRAC mutations , so basically I 'm doomed ! lol I am so sorry to read about the fear and hopelessness that some of you are having ! None of you are toast and you CAN beat this disease !!! My first diagnosis was in 1999 , had a lumpectomy , rads , AC chemo and they took all my nodes on that side . I was recently diagnosed with a new cancer in the same breast and had a double mastectomy 2 weeks ago . will be starting chemo soon as part of a study on triple negs If anyone wants contact info on the study , let me know and I will post it . Anyway , I just want to say that your mental state in fighting this crap is more important than anything . It 's essential that you KNOW you can beat this and that you keep a sense of humor about it . Yeah , it 's scary , especially for those of us that are genetically programmed before birth to be breast cancer patients , and yeah , the treatments can suck big time , but my motto the first time around was `` it beats the other option '' , which is just giving in to the disease . This time around my motto is `` death is NOT an option '' . So hang on ladies for the ride of your lives , but know that at the end you will get off this roller coaster !!!! You ALL are in my prayers ! "
0,TRUE,Hello everyone ... started rads today and things went well . I have my own special road map on me . I hope this really does take the pain away . I finally saw Jim -LRB- trainer -RRB- yesterday and we worked on an exercise program . He only wants me to do the treadmill for 15 min and the other weights 1 set each . He says he thinks it is best even if I can get 3 x a week in . It was really good to see him . He gave me a hug and said he missed me . How sweet is that !
2,TRUE,"Congratulations Fran on finishing your chemo treatments . Hooray ! I have n't read the boards for a week or so ... my energy has come back and I 'm in full steam ahead mode , working too much , etc. . I put off all my doc appointments until February so January has been appointment free and it 's been great -- my hair is growing much to slowly for me but at least it 's growing , right ? Mindy , let us know the results of your biopsy , girl ! AT this point , if there is anything wrong `` down there '' with me , I am going to ask them to just take it out ... am so sick of doctors , needles , feeling like crap , etc ... Last summer I never believed there was a light at the end of the tunnell and I 'm cherishing how I feel today . It 's freezing here ! Love to all of you , Brigitte "
2,TRUE,"Dearest Roxy , You are nearing the end of Rads with fortitude of body per your description , and inquiring of mind per your post : both bode so well for you along your breast cancer journey . You raise valid questions regarding two of your tumor 's specific markers : the ki67 -LRB- cell proliferation -RRB- and mutation of the p53 gene -LRB- a cell `` stress '' detection gene -RRB- . Yet the experts themselves caution us not to read into any one or two specific markers/genes too much , as it takes a village to describe one 's picture more fully . This village to date may best demonstrated by the Oncotype DX , which until now has been used for node negative breast cancer . I understand since your situation involved a node , this test was mostlikely not run . Recently , some experts have noted it may help in node positive breast cancer too , as it provides a 21 factor analysis . Matthew Ellis , in a recent Journal of NCI editorial states of this test : '' When compared with the positive results obtained by Paik et al. -LRB- 3 -RRB- with the 21-gene recurrence score assay , which was able to identify a group of high-risk , node - negative , hormone receptor -- positive patients who differentially experienced benefit from CMF , the results reported by Viale et al. -LRB- 1 -RRB- serve to emphasize the point that predicting chemotherapy sensitivity in the hormone receptor -- positive subgroup requires an assay that integrates more biologic parameters than just the baseline rate of cell cycle progression '' . -LRB- Edit : the ki67 suggest cell cycle progression -RRB- . As to your question of would a full mastectomy in light of a mutated p53 gene -LRB- hence a cranked up stress gene more than a calm , behind the scene one of low stress -RRB- well this is a question for a breast cancer expert . It 's a valid question , and if your doctor wo n't give you an answer , you might appeal to your HMO/Primus to allow you , on the basis of these marker/gene studies . to travel to a Comprehensive or University based Cancer Center . I 'd just type of a letter requesting formal breast expert consultation and submit it to the committee along with your pathology sheet . Even your HMO/Primus allowing a telephone consultation/review may be helpful to ease your valid questions with valid answers . So , where does this leave you Roxy ? Well , your therapy is nearing its end , aside from hormonal therapy for the high estrogen receptor status . I ca n't recall whether you do or do not have PR receptors ? But having high estrogen receptor status clearly puts you in the captains seat in a positive way . You already are pushing for the oophorectomies which will allow an AI , or aromatase inhibitor , which have been shown to slightly improve disease free recurrence , and one -LRB- Letrozole -RRB- to be shown to increase Long Term disease free recurrence . So , in the end , beg , plead , and ... well , beg again for Letrozole just because of your specific circumstances . In the short term , do everything you can to hurry up the surgery : make sure your part of the paper work is done , appeal if necessary by letter the information as provided above and why it may be beneficial to you to have your surgery sooner than 3 months , and hey , what it would it be without me putting in a plug for immediate testing of your ability to even metabolize Tamoxifen into it 's active drug : endoxifen . This is done by simple blood or cheek swab on your own DNA , and sent of to a lab like Mayo , or LabCorp or DNA direct , and is called the CYP2D6 gene analysis . You can pm me for more on this , or look under the hormonal threads where there has been lots of discussion about it . It cost 's about $ 300 . Geez , this is too long an answer . But I applaud your approach and true grit determination Roxy . Perhaps that 's the best answer in and of itself . Do n't let the breast cancer -LRB- or other -RRB- beat you down . Knowledge is power , and you ask hard questions . Where are you located by the way ? Indiana ? There 's some great research coming out of the University of Indiana , as elsewhere . It helps to know to give help . And that 's what we 're here for ! Tender "
6,TRUE,"Kathy ... I 'm sorry about your BRCA status . I am BRCA1 . My stupid luck ... I found out a year prior to my cancer ... I was monitoring with MRI , mammo , CA125 and sonograms for the Ovarian cancer . Exactly a year to the date of my BRCA1 ... I found BC via mammo . Of course I did the Bilat and oopherectomy at the same time . Have you been to the FORCE.org website ? It is a great place for BRCA gals . PM me if yo uneed and other BRCA support ... I have a few friend in the same boat ... "
6,TRUE,yep same problems here . On ixempra too . Had this same prob -LRB- but worse -RRB- with taxotere . one of my eyes is itchy and skin is crusty . vision def changed . when this happened last time i went to eye doc and got drops -LRB- cuz i had infections then -RRB- and after chemo infections cleared up and vision went back to what it was before so this time not going unless i have to . hope this helps . sounds like we are all in same boat unfortunately .
0,TRUE,"I have widespread DCIS -LRB- meaning lots of those tiny dot concentrations -RRB- in my right breast and am undergoing a mastectomy on Feb. 10th . I 've had since mid-December to come to terms with this horrifying news , and yet it remains difficult to accept because of what you 're saying -- because DCIS is n't life-threatening . If we let this go , it 's possible that I could live through my 80 's and kick the bucket from some other cause , that the DCIS would n't amount to anything . But -- as both my first and second opinion breast surgeons have told me -LRB- at 2 different hospitals in NYC -RRB- -- we just ca n't take that chance . In fact , an additional biopsy showed that I actually have a `` micro-invasion '' of bad cells beyond the duct . Both surgeons said the same thing : the only solution is a mastectomy . It 's a tough pill to swallow . I 'm losing a breast , and down the road it may be something else which kills me ! And incidentally , I 'm in my late 30 's , in good shape , feel great , plenty of energy to handle my 2 young kids . This threw me for a loop , too . Hopefully , you 'll be able to have a lumpectomy . Take care ... "
4,TRUE,"Sue , Thanks for searching me out . I just finished catching up on your thread . You have been on quite the roller coaster ride . After a rough couple days at home -LRB- I could n't even feed myself my arm hurt so had and was so swollen -RRB- I think I have finally turned the corner and am starting to feel better . I was pretty drugged up for a while . I got my drains out today , what a relief that was . I have fluid in my lungs and have been coughing quite a bit , which is really painful on the incisions from the hysterectomy . And go figure , I did 5 months of chemo , and never once threw up , but I was SO nauseated and threw up from the pain meds . Yuck ! Well , the worst is over , and now I am on the road to recovery . Thanks for checking on me ! Hugs to all ! "
4,TRUE,"Charmaine - I believe that too ! My husband and I would sit in the Chemo room laughing away , and I think some of the other patients thought we were mad . My husband has even started making `` one-boob '' jokes , which I am sure are pretty tasteless , but they make me laugh . Crying certainly is n't going to change anything ! My Onc is a huge believer in `` being positive '' , whether it is going to make any difference in the eventual outcome is debatable , but it will certainly make the ride more pleasant . "
0,TRUE,Ren ... SO sorry to hear this ... I am going through a scary road right now myself . I was just 10.5 weeks post radiation treatment and I started having shoulder and neck pain . I called my Doctor and the nurse told me it sounded like a muscle . She said I have you down to do protocol scans middle of June and then see the Doctor . I said yea but IT REALLLLY HURTS ... she said well if it will make you feel better we can move the scans up ... I said yea I would like to do that . Well FAST FORWARD ... scans revealed 4.5 by 1.5 cm tumor attatched to my chest wall . I do not have any breast . I did a double mastectomy 5/21/2009 . I did ask my Dr. yesterday if it was ANYWHERE else and she said no . It is located under the clavical area above the first rib and on the chest wall ... ... Husband and I are going for a second opinion to Cancer Treatment Centers Of America . We fly out Tuesday evening ... . . I want you to know you are in my thoughts and prayers and I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST ... and as far as chemo ... I am not sure just yet for me what that will be ...

2,TRUE,"Well Ladies , I got my results . They are not a I had hoped . I have breast cancer . I believe it is HER2 pos . The tumor is 1.5 cm so not so big . I should have a MRI around the first of the year . The doc is recommending lumpectomy , radiation and chemo or mastectomy and chemo with no radiation unless during a sentinal node biopsy , something is found then . Trying to deal with all the emotions but most difficult is going to be to tell my ten year old daughter who is the light of my life . Pray for me and my family tonight as it will be a difficult one . Thanks for all your responses and I 'm sure I 'll be posting a lot soon . "
0,TRUE,"Hi Krista - Like Grammy said , not a walk in the park , but doable . I started my TAC on Jan 8 , 2008 . I just got through # 2 -LRB- 1/29/08 -RRB- . Here 's what I know from my experience . I have all 3 drugs ... takes about 3 hours ... once every 21 days . I was n't prepared for the horrid digestive acrobatics my stomach was going to do . Yeah , I knew I could be constipated or have diarreah , but heartburn and gas ... had no clue . After round # 1 , I was ready . I prepare by taking Miralax once per day and Pepcid AC and Gas X am and pm on the day before then on through about day 10 . This time around was much better on my gut . Now , that is n't to day that you may not feel like there 's a rock in your gut most of the time , but it is n't as bad as having that plus constipation , heartburn , and gas on top of it . Have Vaseline on hand to use inside your nose - it may get really dry and bleed . Vaseline keeps it nice and moist . Use it on your lips , too if you do n't have a lip salve you really like . Drink as much water as you can the day before , day of , and day after to help flush those drugs through quickly . Eat light small meals as your stomach is not its normal self even if you do n't feel nauseous , which you should n't if your oncologist gives you Aloxi in your drip and offers you other options . I have n't needed anything beyond the Aloxi . A small meal can be as simple as a scrambled egg and applesauce . Try to eat as healthy as you can during this ... it will tempting to just eat bland carbs all day ... but I find that those bland carbs not only have no flavor , but no real nutritional value . During tx # 2 , I chose to eat differently . A piece of whole grain toast tastes better and is better for you . Eat yogurt , fruit , and veggies plus a lean protein as much as you can in small doses throughout the day . Oh , you will be given a steroid to take the day before , day of , and day after . It can have a stimulant effect like drinking three cups of coffee in a row , so make sure you do n't take it too late . Some gals take Tylenol PM to help them sleep . I have n't had a problem ... I take my pm dose then before bed I take a leftover Valium from my surgery given for muscle spasms . Works like a charm for me . The steroid may cause you to retain water as will Taxotere , so do n't freak out ... it will go away especially with all the water you 'll be drinking . If water begins to taste bad , add something to it like lemon or some other flavoring . Your taste buds will change and things will not taste the same or may even taste bad . This usually goes away the third week before you have to gear up to do it all over again ... so you will have a good week for taste buds . You may have dry mouth and mouth sores ... biotene toothpaste and mouthwash is great for that ... and of course drinking lots of water . -LRB- I know I am so sick of water , but adding flavor helps , and it is n't to say you ca n't drink other things that taste good ... just be aware of the calories and nutritional value . -RRB- My hair started feeling unhealthy pretty quickly . I had a small puppy 's worth of hair in the shower by day 10 , which is when I had my Shaving Party . If you 're going to get a wig , do it before your hair starts to fall out so you can match your color if that 's important to you . Also , check into the Look Good Feel Good class offered through the American Cancer Society ... lots of gals have raved about the class . I chose not to attend as I did n't need all the free makeup and stuff ... I have sensitive skin and use Bare Minerals . I have a thread called Poetry Anyone ? that has some of my poetry ... some serious and others humerous like Side Effects Circus if you need a pick me up and to remember this is only a small bump in the road ... it is temporary ... and a year from now , you 'll be looking back at this experience and saying , look what I did ! And of course , you 'll be sharing your experience with someone else who needs a little support . Keep checkin ' in ... SIS -LRB- Sister In Survival -RRB- Kimberly "
0,TRUE,"Thanks for your post , Cathy . Yes , I was looking at the mastectomy to avoid the radiation . So , I need to do my homework before I see the radiation oncologist . I had a SNB with 6 nodes removed and one of the two sentinel nodes had a micromet of .2 mm . The other five nodes were clean . The standard of care for my case is to go back and do a full axillary dissection . But of the six doctors I conferred with , no one agreed with that approach . They all said that my risks of lymphedema from the axillary dissection far outweighed my risk of the micromet causing problems down the road ... especially since I was having chemo anyway . Now I need to ask the radiation oncologist whether that micromet means I need radiation in the underarm area . My tumor was close to the chest wall but my pathology and surgeons write-up say that she obtained `` wide margins '' all around . I am getting a second opinion on the pathology just to be sure . Time for me to get a list of questions ready ! "

2,FALSE,"Hello ladies - I would be the absolutely LAST person to get on a soapbox about smoking - believe me , I smoked for about 35 years and only quit last April 2nd - the reason why ? Because PS said I had to be smoke free for about 8 weeks prior to PBM/recon - that was all the incentive I needed - I have been trying to get PBM and BRCA testing paid for by insurance for a couple of years - they finally agreed to pay for all and my surgery day could n't come quickly enough . For me it was really a non issue - I have quit many times -LRB- of course ! -RRB- - sometimes for years at a time and you have to wonder why I always go back to it - I am just one of those people who truly enjoy smoking - with a cup of coffee , a nice glass of red wine , etc. . And I do n't know why but it is never a problem for me to quit - I just do and never have any cravings or anything - I guess I am blessed in that respect ! My PS is so adament that he does a nicotine urine test the morning of your surgery - if you are n't nicotine free , no surgery . I just had Stage II done a couple of weeks ago - and guess what - totally nicotine free since the beginning of April and I still had problems healing from both surgeries and had to go back in for more surgery both times - has nothing to do with smoking or not . Now that I am feeling better and all surgeries are behind me -LRB- getting tats on Nov. 2nd but all actual surgery is finished -RRB- I keep thinking I would like a Marlboro light and a nice glass of wine but then I think how foolish would that make me to start all over again ? Still have n't made a decision on if I will go back to it or not - DH is not a smoker but he never minds me smoking - he actually gets furious with all the do gooders that want to make smoking illegal - he says how many people kill another because of a cigarette and how many drunk drivers kill people daily - he truly gets irate by it all and says when they ban alcohol , then they can ban tobacco . And they never go after the cigar and pipe smokers - just the cigarette smokers . Sheesh ! Anyway - no lectures for me - everyone has their own triggers to stop and start - but because I know you want to quit , I will pray for you that it works . Hugs and blessings , Cindie "

2,TRUE,The reason I am asking is because last Thursday I had my annual gyn appt . They took a urine sample and paps test . I just received a call today to call my gyn 's office . Now I am worried that something worrisome was found in either my urine test or paps test . For some strange reason I am more worried about the urine test than the paps test . I had a paps and HPV test a year ago and everything was fine . I know that my gyn normally does not call if everthing came out fine . What type of tests do they run on your urine ? Is there anything in the urine that could be worrisome for recurrence ? I guess it could be some type of infection or an abnormal pap . I just hate going to the doctor because they always seem to find something . After a cancer diagnosis it is hard to trust your body again and I always think something is going to go wrong again . Can anyone shed some light on urine tests ?

0,TRUE,"Thanks for posting this topic . I had right side lumpectomy and radiation completed in May of last year . I had minimal side effect except skin color change to light pink .

I then had bilateral mastectomy and recontruction due to new cancer on the left side . Both sides have implants with the right side had LD flap surgery . I have exactly the same implants on both sides but the right looks slightly flatter . My plastic surgeon thought it might be because of the ribcage on the right side is flatter .

I have had endless tests since then at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston : bone scan , CT scan , breast MRI , MUGA scan , EKG , hearing test , a pelvic ultra sound and brain scan yesterday . The pelvic scan is because the CT found a 5.9 cm `` complex septated cyst '' on my right ovary . I had another 5-core biopsy of the tumor on Tuesday as well as fine needle aspiration of an enlarged lymph node under my arm . That came back as inconclusive so they had to do another FNA on an enlarged lymph node deep to my subpectoral muscle .

2,TRUE,"NancyD , I had problems with a floating or wavy blind spot too . I was on Taxotere and Cytoxan when it first happened . Left eye twitched at the end of chemo too . Eye doctor was a jerk and said nothing wrong , problem not from chemo , just stress . Then tried to get me to do some kind of botox injection to paralyze the muscle that would twitch . The twitching slowly went away and only returns when I am sick or receiving treatment . The blind spot stopped showing up in the last six months . You might want to try this idea though . The second eye doctor gave me a piece of graph paper and said to fold it up and carry it around in my billfold . If I ever get the spot , I should take out the graph paper and test which eye is having the blind spot -LRB- close one eye and then the other -RRB- . Then hold the paper in front of your face -LRB- 12 inches approx . or further , if possible , measure with a ruler so you can get the same measurement each time it happens -RRB- .

Also note if everything else goes black and white or if there is color . When you have a few entries , go back to the doctor to show the results .

I had decided to get a mastectomy and Diep recon even before knowing my Her2 status . Still it was a shock to learn that I 'd need chemo and Herceptin - I thought by going the radical route of mastectomy I could avoid chemo . I agree with the other women who have advised you to seek out the genetic testing . If you end up BRCA1 or 2 positive , then it may give you more confidence moving ahead with a bi-lat and recon . However , if you 're negative - and you 're Her2 - , you may wish to take a less radical approach and go for the lumpectomy and rads . The mastectomy and recon surgery is difficult ... ... ... you can end up with many complications you never envisioned . Besides the MRSA staph infection which destroyed my abdominal muscles -LRB- and now I need more surgery to repair the big bulge -RRB- - I am saddened that I have lost sensation in the skin from my abdominal incision , up past my navel and to my chest bone . I also have no feeling in my new foob so I 'm glad that I kept the other breast . I know how scary the shock of a dx first is - how quickly we can c ome to a decision - but it 's ok to change your mind .

Mine was a very tiny , tiny area of DCIS -LRB- 1.6 mm -- less than 1/10th of an inch ! -RRB- and I had clear margins after a surgical excision . I have not had any additional treatment besides my excisional biopsy last July which got all of the DCIS out . At follow up appt . a week after the biopsy , a medical oncologist spoke with me and told me that my tumor was sooo tiny he thought there was a miniscule chance it would cause me problems down the road and he did not recommend radiation therapy or hormonal therapy with their associated risks and side effects for my particular situation . He actually told me I was not to lose sleep over this or worry about it and he never expected to see me again . I also met with a radiation oncologist who wavered a bit on his recommendation , -LRB- seems like you , I was sort of in a ` gray ' area on rad treatments -RRB- but ultimately told me after we had a long discussion that he says I get a pass on this and that with my particular circumstances that if I were his wife , he would NOT treat me with radiation . Therefore , I decided against doing anything more except for close monitoring with mammograms and MRI 's as needed . Since that time I have had both follow up digital mamm on my left side in December '08 and a follow up MRI in Feb '09 as well as a regular annual bi-lateral screening on both breasts about two weeks ago -- things apparently look fine for now as radiologist did not see anything he felt was ` alarming ' .

2,TRUE,"dazed , I 'm going to play the other side of the fence . You were very lucky with the DCIS and in only one spot . The rads and tamox may be less painful , less complicated and easier on you physically and emotionally than the reconstruction surgery , and may be just as effective in your case . You , of course , have to make the decision that 's right for you , but maybe you do n't have to take that drastic step , especially in light of the problems you are encountering . You may be able to keep your own breasts and still have the same odds at survival . Good luck with the dr. apptmt on the 25th and with whatever you decide . "
0,TRUE,"Hi . I just had my exchange surgery two weeks ago , and I can sympathize with what you are going through . I too , had a nipple sparing mastectomy back in September and part of my nipple became necrotic . I had a deep wound that needed to be debrided daily and it took about three months to get it under control . It has to heal from the inside out and aside from doing wound dressings , it is just a waiting game which seems two steps forward , one step back . I understand how down you are feeling right now because I personally have been there . However , the good news is that it does take a lot of time , but amazing it does heal even though it looks like it never will . My plastic surgeon is going to reconstruct the part that I lost down the road , and he said it will be better than ever . Truefully , it looks pretty good now that it has healed and I do n't even really think about it too much .

Personally , I am all for doing whatever will keep me here for the one baby I do have , however I am glad I did n't do anything hasty . I have my annual OB appointment next week so I 'm going to chat with her a bit . I desperately want another baby but there 's one thing I want more ! To see my son grow up . "
4,FALSE,"It 's a good thought . My doctor is in NYC and I am in northern NJ so it is really not all that convenient to take a ride over to the office . But , if I need to do it , I will . The results themselves are not that important to me . I do n't think I would change my path regardless of what the results show . What I really want to find out is if they are intentionally being evasive because the results show that maybe the chemo is not likely to help - even though they were pushing it on me because that is their `` standard '' protocol .

2,FALSE,"Hi Karenanne , If you are just getting the dye , mine was injected at the edge of the areola - this was done when I was already under , however , I also got the nuclear shots . This was 4 shots also around areola at 12 , 3 , 6 , & 9 oclock positions . They did apply the EMLA cream prior , but I still felt the shots . They are like a constant bee sting ... but only lasts for about 20 - 30 seconds . They even allowed my husband to come into the room . It was not the worst thing that I have been through on this bc trip . After these shots you must lie still under an x ray machine while they trace where the shots drain to . This one to three nodes will be the sentinel node . I had only one node light up prior to surgery , and after they shot the blue dye in during surgery , they pinpointed the node itself as it also turned blue . I had a lumpectomy on June 16 , and can still see -LRB- faintly now -RRB- a circle of blue on my breast where it was injected ! Good luck on Tuesday ! "
2,TRUE,"Dear juljon , I know that things are tough right now and I am sending love and light to you and your family during this time . It 's never easy when your parent is diagnosed with cancer . I 'm a survivor and my father battled colon cancer 5 times before passing 3 years ago . I just wanted to reach out to you and offer my support and help . I did a post on my blog for others on the cancer journey about how to help your loved one when they are just diagnosed http://blog.cincovidas.com/your-loved-one-just-got-the-news%E2%80%94cancer-how-can-you-help . I hope that this can be of some help to you and your family . Please feel free to contact me if I can be of help in any way . Remember to take time for yourself as well . The most amazing thing that my father 's cancer did was bring my family and I closer together and cherish every minute of our time together . I certainly got my priorities straight as well and I realized that what I thought was important was really not - cherish every moment and keep reaching out , you do not have to do this alone ! Love brings hope and healing and I know that it will for you mother as well . Love , strength and survival , Britta "
6,TRUE,"Thank you for the input ladies . I had a very difficult time when I was initially diagnosed ; I think it would have been much easier had I been able to talk to others in the same boat . The support group I went to , unfortunately , made me feel worse -LRB- not that anyone purposely said or did anything to make me feel that way , it was just a difficult time in my life -RRB- . I have been wanting to start a DCIS group for 3 years but it wo n't do me much good if I am the only one there LOL . Even my own doctor ca n't give me the names of anyone . There are a couple of BC organizations in my area - very active ones it seems . I could contact them to get their ideas about this , though I think the general feeling is that it is `` just DCIS '' and who needs support for that . That is why I am wondering if anyone here is a member of a group such as this or if you would go if you had the opportunity . If you all say do n't bother with it , it is n't needed , well then I probably wo n't do anything about it but if you say you would go to one if you have the opportunity then I might pursue it with more energy .

My onc said they 'll sort it out over the next year , but for right now nobody really knows for sure if it will help someone like me . He did n't want me to get it today , and did n't think my insurance would cover it anyway . My response was that I 'd rather get it and not need it rather than wait and find out I did need it and did n't get it . So finally I asked him if he would let me get it if the insurance company pre-authorized it , so at least I 'd feel covered while it was all sorted out .

2,FALSE,"Yes , I am a Christmas Chemo Cadette too . My first -LRB- TAC -RRB- chemo was Friday December 10th . I breezed through the first two days - and think that the premeds including steoids were what helped the most . Day 3 was starting to feel a little nausea , headaches and achy . Then Monday I went in for my Neulasta shot and boy that really set me back a bit . I felt body aches and general flu-like symptoms - just felt like crap again the next day . Today , I am starting to feel like a real person again . Severe constipation has been my biggest issue . . I had been drinking lots of water , taking Senakot-S , eating fiber , Metamucil , and Miralax - and still no action .

2,FALSE,"Being stage1V I am permanently on one chemo or another . What I 've found , is that the first cycle of any drug is the worst . I really need to allow a week for any semblance of normality to return . However , subsequent cycles seem to be easier-whether it 's because I 'm better prepared mentally , almost anticipating what to expect-who knows ! But it does get easier . Hold on too , to the fact that your treatment wo n't last forever-each one you have is a huge step closer to the end . Even following the simple advise of things like - drink lots - can make a vast difference to your overall well being . I see from your posts that you only had chemo on 16th-the side effects should be vanishing soon-and they do in my case-they do n't diminish slowly , but quickly ! I liken it to turning a light on and off . Be patient , and stick with it-you 'll find a way of coping-or at least putting up with it . Quitting after one cycle sounds a bit of an over reaction-and by the time you have the 2nd , well you 'll be a third of the way to completion , so you may as well go the distance ... "

The medication I am to be putting on the nipple , CVS and Walgreens do not have - Povidone , so will have to wait until next week to get the proper medication . That part is frustrating . I probably did not do enough research prior to the surgery , but the Drs. never really told me about TE 's . I 'm not sure if that is because it was skin sparing , but regardless , I am happy to already have them in and not have to do another surgery down the road . I get so confused when I read some of the forums because so many different type procedures are done .

0,TRUE,"I had bilateral mastectomies in June , lymph nodes removed on both sides . I was dealing with swelling in my arms for a few weeks , and then it kind of went away . I saw a lymphedema therapist a few times , and then it seemed I did n't need it anymore . Well , a few months later , I now have a swollen hand . I do the lymphedema massage , which helps only slightly . I elevate it when watching TV in the evening and when I sleep . It only helps slightly . The swollen hand remains . It has been swollen for over a month now . The therapist measures my arms when I see her . She says I will need to order the sleeves and a compression garment for my hand too . The measurements seem to be decreasing -- as in the fact that my arms are decreasing in circumference . I think perhaps the therapist is waiting to order my sleeves until my arm measurements stabilize ?? I am wondering what the delay is in ordering my sleeves . Do you typically wait for the arm measurements to stay the same before the sleeves are ordered ? Is this unusual ? I am just hoping , that by all this waiting , I am not increasing my lymphedema problems down the road or something . Can anyone shed some light on this ? If you are experienced with lymphedema , did you get your sleeves soon after surgery ? or how long after surgery ? Also , the therapist tells me that insurance does not pay for the sleeves . Is this normal ? They are n't that expensive , but it sure would be nice ot have my insurance pay . If anyone can give me any additional info on the sleeves , I would really appreciate it .

4,TRUE,"Good morning all , Work has calmed down , so I can come and breathe and send a nice , long chatty note to all my fellow February chemo cruisers . Leah -- Buon viaggoio ! I love Italy ... I visited Venice and Florence one Christmas holiday season with my younger sister . She had done a junior semester abroad in London and I was working in England , so Italy was close . My sister was minoring in Art History , so I had my own personal guide ! Carynn -- Sometimes it is nice when husbands go away ... but , it 's nicer when they come back !! Piper -- Congrats on your successful second surgery . Somehow my calendar keeping has fallen by the wayside . I did have a giggle thinking about the syringes on your nipples !! Jan -- My secret pal has been much more devious -- obviously someone who 's played this game before ! Terry -- I had my rads onc follow-up visit this week as well . He says that he does not normally recommend MRIs , but does recommend them for me given my presentation and history . However , he never recommends an MRI until at least one year after the end of rads . Apparently , there is still a lot of radiation damage inside that lights up on the MRI . Which is exactly what happened to me , cause my chemo onc had me do an MRI about six weeks after rads was over ! SammieKay -- I 'm so sorry to hear about your painful expanders . How much more do they need to add ? When is your exchange surgery ? I must admit , I have to laugh hearing about 600 cc of saline . My boobs are so small , that if I were to do bilat and reconstruction , I think that 60 cc would just about do it - LOL ! Marsha , Marsha , Marsha -- How are you doing ???? We miss you ... I hope that you are feeling all of our virtual hugs ! Twilah -- I 'm sure that you 're looking forward to getting your last chemo done . Are you drinking enough fluids ? I seem to remember that 's what did us all in the first time around -- we got too cocky by the third one and forgot to force liquids ! Melanie , Terry , Jel , Alyson , Karen , Catherine -LRB- and anyone I 've missed -RRB- -- Sounds like we are all getting on with life , and rolling with the ride . I , unfortunately , do n't do well on rollercoasters -- I even get sick on the baby ones I used to have take my son on . So , I 'm really hoping for a smooth ride . The wierdness about the MRI results has tested my reserve to remain calm . I 'm deliberately trying to focus on the fact that my chest X-ray was clear and my right boob was clear . Everyone tells me to ignore the results on the left breast . Of course , as my rads onc put it , now that we have these results , we have to follow them up . So , I will be checked more than usual for the next year . Now that work has calmed down , I 've got some time to reflect on life and think about what I really want to be doing . I see this as an opportunity to take stock and have a well-organized mid-life crisis ! I 'm still frustrated by aphasia and general forgetfulness . I ca n't blame it on tamoxifen or AIs , so it 's either prolonged chemo-brain -LRB- quite possible -RRB- or the affect of being abruptly dropped into menopause . Whatever the reason , it is frustrating not be at the top of my game , so to speak . Hugs to all , Hillary "

Following treatment I was able to put my husband through flight school this year . I just bought my first condo and am very proud of what I have accomplished . Hubby is now a licensed FAA pilot and things are looking bright . Everyone has been telling me how great I look . I 've been rollerblading 3-5 times per week and eat well .

5,TRUE,"I am over the hump now with 18 down and 15 to go . My skin is red but the only painful spot is under my arm . I have had a crazy week though . Last Saturday I felt a little out of it . I went outside to put some stuff away and was walking next to the pool . The next thing I was in the pool but did n't remember falling . Since the solar cover was on , I had to yell for my husband to come help me out . Monday I discovered that I had walked through the entire neighborhood with one orange shoe and one blue shoe . I also seem to have bouts of fuzzy headed feelings where I lose my train of thought . My radiation oncologist said it was n't from the radiation and told me to talk to my regular Dr. She thinks it is from the radiation but still ordered complete bloodwork and a head CT which all came back normal . Has anyone else had these fuzzy type feelings ? If so , it would be nice if the radiation people would admit that it could be from radiation which would eliminate the need for all of these extra tests . I really thought that since I am keeping active that I would n't have much trouble with side effects , I guess I was wrong . "

Sure am thankful we have each other to walk this road ! "
2,TRUE,"Dawnhope and Hurley-great answers ! I think it sheds some light on my case . He could n't move my implants too close together because of where my muscle ends . He said it several times throughout the process . Also I was smaller breasted before BC , only a B cup so maybe there was not as much of an `` envelope '' as some women have and thirdly I think he was limited by the size of the TE which again goes back to what fit best in my body . I am interested to see how they will change because to me there seems like a lot of `` spare '' room in there . That is what is confusing me now . It 's not that I care if I was bigger . I just do n't want any extra space resulting in rippling which I am seeing already . When I pull my shoulders back and make everything tight I do n't see any rippling , I 'd be happy if it stays just like that . "
2,TRUE,"Thanks for all the responses . I spoke to my onc today -LRB- 4th of 6 tx today -- starting to see the light at the end of the chemo tunnel -- yay ! -RRB- and he said it was probably the Neulasta shot , which I take after every tx . Alishar , I 'm sorry you 're so uncomfortable . If you are registered on Timtam 's photo board , I just posted my expander photo , and I too am higher on one side -- the left . Fortunately , I do n't have a port , I have a PICC line -LRB- you can also see that in the photo -RRB- . If you 're not registered , you can email Timtam from the member list and ask her to register you . It 's a great board for seeing what to expect . I was filled with 350cc during the first surgery and have only had one 50cc fill . I was in a lot of pain in the beginning and took pain medication and valium -LRB- muscle relaxer -RRB- to help me sleep . Do n't be shy about asking your doctor for pain relief . I was fearful of becoming too dependent , but eventually the pain subsided -LRB- and your brain starts to get used to the new normal -RRB- and I do n't take those meds anymore , but I do take Ativan to sleep . I hope you feel better soon . Speck , I went with immediate reconstruction with expanders because 1 -RRB- I did n't have enough tissue for a DIEP flap for both breasts and 2 -RRB- if I had to have radiation I wanted the expanders in to take the hit . But I have also heard about women who have had Venita 's experience . Good luck with your decision . I was `` lucky '' in that there were no lymph nodes involved , and I am not having radiation . Best to all , Carolina "
4,TRUE,"My unilateral mastectomy and Diep took place on March 3rd - and after a staph infection , two weeks of antiobiotics and pain meds , I 'm slowly getting better - but I certainly am far from feeling anywhere near `` normal '' .

I know all this will pass in time , but it is hard to totally move on . I know I am thinking about it less often , and when my hercepton ends in a few weeks and my Stage Two is done tomorrow , it should be easier . Jan , Thanks for the update . I am glad you are feeling better . When do you think you can drive and resume your normal activities ? I go in tomorrow . Lynn , How are you feeling ? Thanks also for the all your information . I go in around 10:30 and if things go as planned , I should be able to leave the hospital around 5:00 . I had to go to Boston for the pre-op because it has been 9 months since I had the DIEP .

I also have not been here lately and have not finished reading all the posts . Meri and her bf came home this weekend , and I have been working , and generally busy doing busy stuff . We just bought a new Corolla on Monday . I just do not go into a dealership and purchase it - I spend hours and hours researching for the best car for us and the best price . I exhaust myself . Then we test drove a Sonata , a Civic and a Corolla , Of course we have been getting a million phone calls from all the salesmen . I must say I love my new little car . It is not sexy , but it is reliable . I have also been helping Meri choose health insurance and auto insurance . She asked for my help , and I was glad she asked me . I know I spend too much time researching all this stuff on the computer . I am finally finished with all my research , so now I can relax before my surgery . Meri is now in Virginia and started school today . At orientation , they told them that they will not have any time to socialize for the next nine months . She sounded kind of nervous - a far cry from undergraduate college - where she sounded like she was always having a good time . She did great in college , but she was always socializing . She just sounds more mature now . I guess I better get to bed now , . We have to leave by 6:30 to get there by 9:00 - darn Boston traffic . Love , Viddie "
2,FALSE,"Don23 , my reconstructed breasts were totally different shapes ! I had a single mastectomy with expander before chemo and then after treatment decided to get the other side removed since I had a family hx . When they exchanged the original expander they did the other side mastectomy with immediate implant . In the ensuing year my radiated side went through some changes that made my faux nipple turn a bit to the side , plus the scarring was really dark . And the implants laid flat and had little projection . So my PS tightened the non-cancer side and secured the pocket on the cancer side -LRB- since the orginal implant was slipping around a bit -RRB- . He revised the scaring from my axillary dissection . He switched two 700 cc implants -LRB- medium profile -RRB- with 800 cc high profile and the change is remarkable ! I was a D cup before and am again , so I am happy . The radiated scar 's nipple is now center on the breast . The pocket is much better , no slippage so far ! The left side is now more rounded -LRB- less pointy -RRB- like the right/cancer side , so while not perfect they look much better , have cleavage and in low lights look really nice ! I am very happy . Oh . . both are silicone . : -RRB- "

I had 4 biopsies , 3 ultrasounds and 5 MRI 's and still they wee not able to find these bad cells .

Dr. Elliott also has a patent on a vaccine given after surgery/chemo to help prevent recurrance . My oncologist is local , came recommended by the staff onco at the center and actually had a Topo-2 alpha test done that shed some `` new light '' on my dx . They changed my original rx of chemo . Dr. McGee was not sure what this test was . The onco explained it is something from a Dr. at UCLA , he received the info by email the night before my first appt with him . I do n't know that much about it , but I think it 's another marker and mine was positive . So I feel that between 2 centers that are apparently `` cutting edge '' , I am very lucky ! "

I checked all the latches to make sure it was firmly attached , and then proceeded to drive it right into our garage , top and all with my son in the backseat . O.k. you say , why did you do that ? Because a minute after registering it 's presence on my car , I forgot it was there . You should have heard my son 's MOM ! So , now we have a car carrier with a roof top hole in it and a bent door shutting apparatus . Same thing happens when I try to take my Arimidex .

My question for this forum ... anybody out there with a weight issue to consider when deciding for mastectomy ? I really feel with my health profile , at 65 years of age , I should not delay getting this completely off my chest . Pardon my pun . I want a bilateral mastectomy , regardless if the right breast is healthy . My breasts are big and lumpy , saggy , I am not attached to them anymore regarding feminine value . I know the surgery will have greater risks at my present weight , however , at my present age , I do not see me stronger down the road in any way to undergo this should it happen again .

I am going to a local nationally know cancer center , Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo , NY , for a second opinion . Sometimes at night , I wonder if I should just go there for treatment . My breast surgeon is the best around town , but I feel afraid to challenge him on the matter . He is very competent and very kind . But I just do n't feel in control . If the MRI shows the right breast involved he has indicated we will discuss mastectomy .

0,TRUE,"I was diagnosed with a recurrence on November 22 and given a chemical ooph -LRB- zoladex -RRB- and AIs . As a result , the tumour under my arm is shrinking . This would suggest to me that an ooph can do the same work as chemo . -LRB- It shrunk considerably even before I started the AIs -RRB- In my case , they decided on the hormonal approach as chemo was clearly not a long-term solution . -LRB- I had been given FEC , and then when that did n't work , taxotere , which did work -RRB- However , my cancer is 90 % ER + , while yours is only 16 . Have you asked your onc about the effectiveness of a hormonal treatment ie . ooph in your case ? I think it would be relevant . On the other hand , I note that you are much more PR + . I 'm PR negative and have read that more PR negative women do n't respond to tamoxifen , as in my situation . I do n't know if this means that the corollary is true ie . that tamoxifen is a good medicine for PR + women . All this being said , I wish I did not have to be put into menopause -LRB- I 'm 42 -RRB- and that I could continue to take tamoxifen and be pre-menopausal as before . I did not have any side effects from the tamox , after the hot flashes stopped 4 months into it , and found it very tolerable . One of the things that I find most distressing is that an early ooph can apparently increase your chance of dementia down the road . A few more points - is `` mod-diff '' a reference to the grade of the tumour ? Also , chemo will not necessarily shut down your ovaries . Mine came back after 13 months and I know this is not unusual . Btw , the hot flashes from ooph and AIs have not been too bad so far . Sorry if this is convoluted and hope it 's of some use to you . It 's not an easy decision you 've got to make . In some ways it was easier for those of us who were told that chemo was absolutely necessary . Darya "

0,TRUE,"A good surgeon will advise you about a lumpectomy versus a mastectomy . The survival rate of both -LRB- if you add radiation to the lumpectomy -RRB- is the same .

Since they wo n't know the answer to that , most likely , before surgery generally those folks decide down the road to have a mastectomy . Some women choose mastectomy because they are so afraid of ever going through this again , but I would caution against that because it is much more difficult surgery .

Hate them . My PS stretched the TE to 600 cc and only put in 475 style 20 high profile . So , I have significant rippling on the top half of the breast and edge of implant is visible . It feels as if there is a gap at the top of the implant and the chest wall . Wonder if the pocket is TOO big causing the rippling . On my augmented side , he used style # 15 213 cc and it is way too small ... absolutely no upper pole fullness . It is a finger width smaller all the way around . It has been extremely depressing for me . I thought I was done with all this -- NOT . I 've consulted a few other PS and two have suggested going bigger to fill out the upper pole . Definitely going bigger on the augmented side ... but I think I would prefer the style # 20 , high profile , rather than the 15 , moderate . Any input would be greatly appreciated . Oh , one surgeon recommended Alloderm on the top for the reconstructed side to correct/hide the rippling ... . what are the pros/cons of this ? "
0,TRUE,"Little Flower , My treatment plan was similar . I had bilateral mastectomies without reconstruction for bilateral tumors . Although my breast surgeon offered me consults for reconstruction at the time of initial surgery , I declined and I am glad I did . Post chemotherapy and radiation , after 2 years from initial surgery , I started to explore my reconstructive options . For me , I felt very comfortable with this process as I was able to explore options in a calm , scientific way rather than with all the stress and fear that comes with the initial diagnosis . I was armed with facts and questions and subsequently made a good decision . I had bilateral DIEP 4 months ago and am thrilled with the results . It feels so wonderful to have warm , naturally looking breasts . I am amazed each day . Everyone takes their own road so to speak through this journey and waiting for reconstruction is a viable option . I suggest you obtain consults with a few plastic surgeons and if you have access to a teaching facility , you may be presented more options . Best of luck to you . "

6,TRUE,I 'm in the same boat now ... had mastectomy on May 27 and was told that Oncologist would be 1-2 weeks Chemo would be 3-4 weeks time then I have radiation and hormone therapy . I got a call yesterday finally for just the oncologist appoint which is n't until July 17 !!!! So that only means that I see him then make the plan which brings me closer to August . I called my nurse and she called me back saying I 'm in the window ... well open it up and let me out so I can get on with this I told her haha . I have a 14 month at home and have tried to get some planning done for treatments this summer as it 's gon na be a hard juggle especially with the daily rad . for 3 weeks straight and everyone is just sort of on standby ... thank god for friends and family !!!!

The PS said I could spend the night , or go home when I wanted , so I went home . I had a 2 hour ride home , I say ride because my husband drove home . There would have been no way I could have drove . You need to have someone drive you home because after the meds and the anesthesia your mind is not clear . I do n't remember a good bit of that day , and I only took one pain pill at about 8pm that night , everything prior to that was residual meds from the surgery . Even though you think you 're ok and your mind is clear , it 's not . Some of the things my husband told me I did or said that day , I do n't remember at all . Apparently when the PS said I could go , I put my clothes on and left .

She said I would have to talk to the doctor , but everything I read says minimum margin is 2-3 mm . I will see BS on Monday . I feel so grateful that I do n't have anything except DCIS , and yesterday I was telling myself that if it was just DCIS , I would n't be upset about having to do a re-excision .

After a long ride home , I find my left side of my belly -LRB- kind of right above the hip bone -RRB- is really swollen and tingly , as is my upper arm .

0,TRUE,"this all reminds me of childbirth . those of us who had `` natural '' childbirth -LRB- sometimes called primitive , just kidding -RRB- found our own way of getting comfortable with the dilating process . I remember that I felt best all scrunched up in the bed , on my knees , rolling and rocking until the pain subsided . The nurses were trying to make me lie on my back and breath deeply . I just could n't . The kid I birthed is fine , a little fresh but otherwise OK . And now she has two little boys who are just as `` fresh '' as she was/is . by the way , when she gave birth , she also assumed a prone , rocking position .

2,TRUE,Hi ! I had surgery 10 days ago and I am worried that I may have lymphodema in my breast . I had a sentinel node biopsy with 9 nodes removed -LRB- no drains -RRB- and a lumpectomy . My breast was sore and somewhat swollen the first few days . This week is it huge ! There is quite a bit of difference between the `` good '' breast and the `` bad '' breast . I expected swelling at the surgical site but not on the whole breast . I know I should call the surgeon but she is out of town and I do n't feel like dealing with her replacement . I have an oncologist appointment tomorrow and i was hoping he would be able to shed light on this . I know you'all ca n't see my breast but what do you think ?

Anyway , I found two of your posts as I was doing a search to find `` someone '' on here who had used , `` Bard Special Care Cream '' during radiation treatments . I 've only had four rad treatments so far . They gave me samples of this cream , and said it would be better to use this than just aloe vera , as the Bard cream has vitamins A , B , D , and E in it that I would need down the road . As I looked at the ingredients however , I was concerned to see that it has alcohol in it . I know that my doctor is execellent in his field , and would only want to use what he thinks is best ; but I like to corroborate things by seeing what folks who actually use the stuff for radiation are saying about it . So , did you have any problems at all with burning etc. using the Bard , and did you use that solely or something else . Also do you know anyone else who used it with good experiences ? I look forward to hearing from you . Thank you . P.S. regarding other Illinois affiliations , I went to Emmaus Bible school which used to be in Oak Park , Illinois back in the mid seventies ; and then I went to Trinity College , in Deerfield , Illinois to get my degree in elementary education .

If I were in your shoes , I am not sure I would do the rads . Have you visited with a radiation oncologist ? Your onc that handles your chemo should not handle your rads .

I 'm sorry that happened to you , I 'm more sorry that you were n't properly informed that this could happen . And , yes , all bc patients get a chest x-ray . The x-ray is not looking for lung cancer but to see if the bc has already spread to the lungs or ribs . Usually the chest x-ray is done before the surgery , as the info may have an impact on weather a mastectomy or lumpectomy is chosen . It 's also not unusual to check a chest x-ray after a long surgery to see if there is any pneumonia developing . What is unusual is for you to be in the hospital longer than overnight , you must have really good insurance ! "

This is really important and i do n't think there is a quick fix . I am doing a ton of herbal things like echinecia but those take forever to build up in your system . Again , Does your onc know about this ? Just worried about you ! And Claudia , thrilled that yur computer is up and running and you are back !! Ya know , after Cancer , there just are no BIG deals !! I can not afford them honestly , but I do get my dander up !! I had a wonderful day and i am just off the beach and whipped . I caught my first red drum of the season and was so stunned as this fish was huge !! I was doing light tackle bec I was figuring on a few mullet in the surf then my rod bent over double.The ocean is rockin ' and the currents are treacherous ! They had the `` no swimming '' flags out today and it was just so wierd as winds were blowing from the north and the ocean surf current was running like a freight train from south to north . I have n't seen it like that in awhile so I was surprised to get any fish at all . And the first red drum of the season out of the surf is like the holy grail for me . i completely missed red drum season last year due to surgery and chemo !! So it just feels like a new chapter is beginning in life -LRB- at least for today -RRB- . These fish are like my ultimate `` totem '' fish and greatest of luck for me-the puppies were bouncing around-so glad to see mummy catch a really big fish finally !! And i always release so back out to the wild waves it went and i know it is a happy camper . Sorry about the spelling errors and such but i need a new keyboard desperately-all of the keys are sticking .

The infusions takes about 3 + hours , according to the nurses , and it takes about 1ξ1/2 hours to get to his office .

It shows , WBC-low , RBC-low , MCV-high , MCH-high , BUN-high , TSH-now in normal range . February 2 blood work was okay , but TSH was elevated , Onc . said we will watch it .

In April , when I had to go for a mammo on my `` healthy breast '' I knew that I could n't go down this road again mentally . I just had a prophylactic surgery on July 13 . My pathology report showed only benign conditions , but many benign things . My doc said I probably would have had a lot of testing and biopsies in the future to question what they were . I also have a strong history of breast cancer in my family , although I am BRCA negative . Yes , it really stunk going through the operations twice , but I would rather endure any physical pain than mental anguish in the future . I know in my heart that I did everything possible that I can on my side . I do not regret my decision at all . The operation itself is not too bad-its those stupid tissue expanders that make it so uncomfortable ! Good luck with your decision . "

It 's a grade 3 version of lcis and treated more like a high grade dcis -LRB- hence the double mastectomy -RRB- . Did n't have to have chemo , rads or tamox . Wondering if I need to worry about alcohol consumption to avoid a reccurence even though I 've had a double mastectomy ? I have always been a light to moderate drinker , but part of the reason the mastectomy was so appealing is I felt like I would n't have to worry about the cancer coming back and second guess everything I was eating/drinking .

0,TRUE,"I posted several days ago and have been through hell with trying to heal from my MRM . The incision for my surgery burst open and had bleeding in three different areas of the incision . I have had several appointments with my surgeon and he took stiches in two of the incisions , gave me antibiodics which I have taken every one of them . I have one area of the incision that still bleeds every day . My skin is so sore from bandages and tapes used , I can hardly stand it . I go back to the surgeon on Thursday of this week and he mentioned he may need to open the whole thing up and pack it . He took a culture to check for infection . He mentioned I probably had an abcess . It really has been quite an ordeal . Everything broke loose the 11th day after surgery . I get some wicked pain in my arm pit , and swelling there also . When you have complications from this surgery it can be so difficult . I know the surgeon has done the best he could , he has a very good reputation and has done alot of mastectomy surgery , I pray daily for healing . I am very very fortunate my lymph nodes all 11 that were removed are all clear . I do not have to have radiation or chemo and no medications . For that diagnosis of no cancer , the pain has been worth it . I know my case is a rare one . Alot of people have very little pain and get over it quickly and on their way in life . I am 63 years old , and we just do n't heal as fast as someone in their 30 's or even 40 's . It just seems like an eternity to just get down to a simple bandage on the incision area .

I also think my take on life is looking at the sunny side of the street . My teenage son and I had this discussion yesterday , My husband and I complement each other in many aspects . One of the things that are most obvious is what he considers bad luck , I consider good luck . For example flat tire on car in driveway would get my response `` I 'm so lucky it happened in the driveway and not on the highway or in parking lot at work '' My husband would say `` Can you believe on how unlucky we are ? We have a flat tire ! '' Just a different take on life . You are at the toughest part of the ride right now . Learning about what you have , surgical options and treatment options .

2,FALSE,"I had a uniDIEP 14 months after my MX . I had the MX in March of ' 08 , followed by chemo and then radiation . I had a TE put in at the time of the MX . Then had the DIEP in May of ' 09 , and did n't have any problems with it , other than a slight infection that did n't start until a month post surgery . Antibiotics took care of it right away . I did n't find it particularly painful , but was restricted in movements for a while - ie , turning the light off beside the bed was too hard - I got an extension cord with a switch so I could do it myself without having to stretch . And my husband had to go with me to walk our two dogs because I was n't allowed to hold onto the leash on that side . I only took the prescription pain meds for a day or two after coming home from the hospital . Same when I had the revision surgery this past November . We had a week 's worth of revolving houseguests for Thanksgiving week starting 2 days after the revision , and in retrospect I would n't do that again . I am going to have to have some more revision work , since it has shrunk and is at least a cup size too small now . I go back in March for in office lipo and fat grafting . You can find my pictures on TimTam 's picture site . Speaking from my experience , the surgery and recovery was n't nearly as bad as I 'd anticipated . "

After wearing a bra all day yesterday and a couple long car rides three days ago and yesterday , my side is really tight and I could n't stand to lay on that side last night . Since rads , that side has been really tight in general and I can only lay on it with caution . Also , that arm now has pins and needles feeling , when I raise my arm up , I feel a pulling sensation in the back of my arm .

0,TRUE,"Found my lump myself at 36 . Mammogram confirmed it . I had a false sense of security at my age that I did not need to worry about BC at my age because they did not even recommend a mammogram until 40 . I can only imagine what false sense of security women will have now that they are trying to push it up 10 more years . All this panel needs to do is come on here and read how many 40 'S and younger are battling BC . Most of us had to find the lump ourselves because I can not tell you how long it had been since I had a gynecologist do a breast exam on me at my yearly screening . Are we just to sit quietly and let younger women who may have a more aggressive cancer die because these screenings do n't save ENOUGH lives ? That seems to be what the panel is saying ... there are not enough added lives saved by doing these exams in the 40 's . Well , as we all know , the pain of that one more life lost because of a young mother , wife , daughter , friend dying of BC is immense and felt by many . Crazy . If breast cancer is such a common cancer in women then what alternative are they proposing ? I feel like we do n't screen enough , not too much . If I had n't had an MRI after being diagnosed with one BC then the small one in my other breast woud not have been found and maybe I would have gone with just one mastectomy . A few years down the road that would have meant more chemo , surgery , money from the insurance company . "

I 've told my Mom and siblings and some close friends . Now , I have over a week to wait before my first meeting with my surgeon . I wonder how long after that I have to wait before we get down to the business of getting on the road to getting better . I find myself noticing every ache or pain in my body and wonder if there are more cancers lurking in my body . No one has suggested that we look any further than my right breast . Waiting is so hard ! I have two young children , 5 & 7 . I have n't told them anything other than I 'm on vacation for a while ... I can tell they know something is up ... they have been really aware of where I am all the time and need to sit with me on a chair ... I do n't want them to be frightened or see me so afraid either .

I used to give blood all the time before all of this happened , but now it is hard to even get the vein to cooperate , let alone to get some blood out of me for blood work . It is very weird . Others I have talked to said it is good to drink a lot of water and that should help some and also warm compresses on your good arm and hand . I 'm not sure why this happens , but apparently it is not that uncommon for us . My arm and hand is still bruised and it 's been almost 2 weeks since my expander exhange surgery .

4,FALSE,"Got back from Glendive this morning . Got all my junk unloaded from the jeep and brought it into the yard and used the battery cables to start my pickup which has been parked in yard with a dead battery for the last month . I 've been cleaning the house and tossing stuff in the back to where it looked like a garbage scow . Drove over to my `` junk holes '' in the pasture and cleared out the junk . Did n't dare start the pits on fire tho because although the ground and the grass is all wet -- it 's very windy and with my luck a stray ash would blow over and burn up my house or barns . I 'll wait til the wind subsides and light up the pits . Then while I had the pickup running , I drove to town and got gas put in it . I made the mistake of taking my dog in the cab with me . He turns into `` Hooch '' when he rides in a vehicle . You 've never seen so much slobber in your life and it 's SO slimy . When we got to town , I took paper towels and wiped his slimy face and took a cloth and water to wipe off my dash . YUCK . Needless to say , he rode in the back on the way home and I remember now why I never take him with me . He 's a knothead . My CEU classes were really interesting and I got 12.5 units for recertification . The speaker on Friday was a swat officer who spoke on bullying and conflict in schools . Very interesting . Yesterday 's topic was The Brain and Learning . We actually made models of the brain out of clay and also another out of instant potatoes . That one really looked like a brain .

4,FALSE,"I agree that getting your abs stronger is very helpful . I actually hired a personal trainer , but you can do it yourself , and getting one of those big exercise balls to do crunches & strethes on , etc. , is a good way to go , less than $ 20 at walmart , and you can use it for stretching a few weeks after surgery . since your abs will be healing , you will be compensating with your back muscles , so get them as strong as possible , too . I did use a walker for a couple of weeks , as my doc said not to straighten up for that long . I also used a lanyard to hold my -LRB- cursed -RRB- drains while in the shower . otherwise , I pinned them to my sweats . I found that pull-on sweats with a wide elastic waistband worked well for me . I wore nothing underneath , as my ps did not require any binders or bras , and in fact , urged me to go free for as long as possible -LRB- it has now been nearly 2 braless years , heh . -RRB- I did not sleep in a recliner , but used alot of pillows in bed . I slept with them under my back & head , knees and arms . I set up a command center on my couch , laptop , phone , snacks & drinks , etc. to help me get out of bed , I actually tied a rope at the end of my bed to help me sit up when I was alone , I could pull on it for added assistance . wore crocs or slides on my feet . use a pillow in the car for under the seatbelt across your lap , do n't forget it for the ride home from the hospital . pillows will be your friends for many occasions . I would also recommend swimming as a way to rehab your arms and chest , and to stretch out your abs as soon as your doc gives the okay to get in a pool . you may be able to get in a private pool sooner than a public . arm exercises with styrofoam barbells and water jogging helped me bounce back , and I got my full range of motion back in my arm thru water resistance exercises . one nice thing , the diep actually relieved alot of my chest tightness that I had after the mastectomy . eat lightly the day before your surgery , as your bowels will pretty much shut down for a few days . take your colace and drink lots of fluids . do n't push yourself too hard during your recovery , this is a time to be good to yourself . but do get yourself up and moving as soon/much as you can handle , this will also help you bowels to get started again . I drank coffee when I felt like it , and this helped , too . -LRB- I always felt life is hard enough without giving up caffiene . -RRB- get a haircut before surgery so you do n't have to worry about that for a few weeks . consider asking your ps to give you a special new belly button , mine is shaped like a heart , which I did not request , but love . and remember , you will feel much better each day , really . on day 2 , I doubted that I would ever feel human again . by day 3 , I was dressed , packing my stuff and going home . xox , Pat "

He promised me fully cohesives , then after 3 fill told me no he was not in the study . He told me it would be easier for him to get better symetry and I was lopsided -LRB- had to have an entire redo within 1 year -RRB- . I was promised fewer scars and I have more scars than the average individual . . I wanted nipple sparing but at the time a ps was n't available for me to have that locally - now I would leave town to get it because I believe that the brain accepts the natural nipple and therefore the surgery better than a new look -RRB- . It 's all a crap shoot , we do as much research as we can but when that doc put me to sleep it was all out of my hands . . Do n't get me wrong this guys is considered the best -LRB- or was -RRB- in our town !

I 've been trying to get out and walk with my husband when he takes the dogs out , depending on the heat here in south Florida , it can be really brutal , especially lately . I am waiting to heal from the port removal and then am starting up with my old workout routine - pilates machine 2x a week , light weights and increased walking , as much as I can handle with the rads . I did not gain weight , stayed right about the same , but had just started working on the 15 lbs I 'd like to lose before I was dx , so I need to work on that again . I do still get tired very easily at night , and I do think some of it could be residual from the chemo , and some from just not moving much in the last couple of months . I am usually fairly physical with my job at times , and I 've been lucky that I have n't needed to or have had lots of help here .

0,TRUE,"Had a bilateral and did not have nipple sparing since they discovered the cancer had gone into my nodes .

Very new to this since I was diagnosed on 10/25 and had surgery on 11/03 so if anyone can give me some insight from experience what goes into reconstructing the nipples I would really appriciate it .

It took a fair amount of effort to get the first appointment -LRB- and a 5 week wait -RRB- ; however , the actually surgery was scheduled very quickly . The Cancer Center is 2-1/2 hours away , but I can take the train for most visits . Why did I go there ? 1 . Better pathology department .

Seven years ago , I could not have a true sentinel node biopsy locally . While the attention is less personal and sometimes I see a nurse for followups rather than the surgeon , I have continued to go to the cancer center for mammograms , periodic MRI 's -LRB- and 4 additional biopsies , fortunately benign . -RRB- I had chemo locally and participated in a clinical trial recommended by an oncologist at the cancer center .

2,TRUE,I will be 2 weeks post op on Friday . I had the sentinal node biopsy and the lumpectomy .

I see the medical oncologist tomorrow for first visit hoping he can shed some light here ... Anyone had this and if so how long does the swelling last ?
0,TRUE,"Well surgery went well with my lumbectomy , Dr. said everything went great & that he got clear margins and the Nodes were clear ... PHEW ! Just will wait for final pathology to see exactly what it all was . I ended up having also the 12 O'clock cluster of cells removed as well on the same breast as the DCIS because according to the 1st biopsy it said benign but Dr. said it still looked suspicious on the mri and was not ok leaving it there he said it looked like it could turn into DCIS later on down the road as well , he also took the cyst that brough me in there originally . I have a sense of relief now and will learn more in the next few weeks but as he said looks like radiation and hormone therapy . My mind was just obsessed with the whole lymphnode business & was so scared it was there so the news that they were clear was refreshing . Thanks for all the prayers and positive thoughts it was a huge help ! I have an appt with the oncologist this Wed. but not sure if they will have my final path results or not . Still nervous but everyone says that the treatment that I have been told I will have will probabally not change . It has been nice to sleep thats for sure . "

2,TRUE,"Mastectomy removes close to but not 100 % of breast tissue , so there is a very , very small chance of recurrence after mastectomy . Since you 've had a flap reconstruction there is a very good chance that the lump is fat necrosis . This happens when part of the transplanted fat dies and then hardens . This is more common shortly after reconstruction but can occur later . I 'm not sure how well MRI or CT or Ultrasound can tell fat necrosis from cancer . Everything that can not be positively identified on a scan is called a mass , so try not to let the terminolgy freak you out more than necessary . The location of the mass near a lymph node does add to the concern , but the odds are still very , very low that this lump is a rucrrence of bc . I would recommend that you also contact your plastic surgeon about the lump -- he or she will have info on file aobut your surgery that can shed light on what it happening now . "

I have never found info saying less than 2 mm actually makes it ADH and there was no mention of ADH in any of my path reports . BTW -- I have not had any additional treatment besides my excisional biopsy back in July which got all of the DCIS out . At follow up appt . a week after the biopsy , a medical oncologist spoke with me and told me that my tumor was sooo tiny he thought there was a miniscule chance it would cause me problems down the road and he did not recommend radiation therapy or hormonal therapy with their associated risks and side effects for my particular situation . He actually told me I was not to lose sleep over this or worry about it and he never expected to see me again . I also met with a radiation oncologist who wavered a bit on his recommendation , but ultimately told me after we had a long discussion that he says I get a pass on this and that with my particular circumstances that if I were his wife , he would NOT treat me with radiation . Therefore , I decided against doing anything more except for close monitoring with mammograms and MRI 's as needed .

0,FALSE,"Kristy , as of Dec 23rd I 'm on a 2ξ1/2 to 3 week break to counterattack the SE 's and try and get me back to ` normal ' before I start again on a reduced dose .

I got an RX for Lomotil , only took it once and It 's now the 28th and the D seems to be mostly gone - still the odd episode but the queasiness still shows up every once in a while and I 'm slowly getting over the fatigue . My ` gut ' seems to be constantly in a state of rumbling but I 'm hoping after the break I 'll go back on at 200mg and see if that works for me . The Trial nurse and Onc both want to make sure I 'm free of SE 's before I go back on so she 'll call me about Jan 7th to see how I 'm doing and we 'll go from there . Frankly it 's the fatigue that is the most debilitating since it really affects how you get through your day - I also really NEED to get on some kind of regular exercise program to build my stamina which had never recovered after the chemo/herceptin . I 'm really a sloth so this will be the biggest thing for me and finding a way to get walking out here in the COLD country with slippery roads and no lighting - going to -27 C today with the wind so it 's time to dig out the ` walk away the pounds ' tapes and see if I can push myself to get going with those !

When I finally found out that I could n't do it , that is when the strength from above came over me . There is great power in prayer , when we totally give up and give it over to the Lord . It is true . As long as I fixed my attention on Jesus , I was able to keep on going . Only way I got through chemo was to listen to songs of praise on my CD and then I would n't cry . Life is very tough and we do not know why some of us have such valleys . But I do know that we come through stronger and more appreciative of life and better able to relate to others walking the same road . I now work in hospice sitting with dying people .

0,TRUE,"Just wanted to chime in ... have more access to a computer since my son got a job after 4 years in the Marines !! I chose having both breasts removed even though I was Hormone receptive and can take whatever new drug they have by the time I have finished chemo and radiation .

So far I have no signs of lymphedema and I make sure to use the arm to keep it flexible .

4,FALSE,"The first time -LRB- 1999 -RRB- I was at work as a nurse practitioner at a pulmonary group in Memphis TN . I had ordered my diagnostic mammogram under one of my docs names because I could n't get into my PCP and had a bad feeling about a thickened area in my breast . It was suspicious and I had a biopsy . I got a call from the hospital and a young women wanted to know where they could get my films because the surgeon who had done the biopsy wanted to present my case at the cancer conference the next day . That is how I found out I had cancer . I had a melt down right then and there . I can remember telling this poor young women that I had not heard from my doctor yet . The doctor I worked with called to get the path report and to let the hospital know what had happened . She also called the surgeon to let him know what had happened . Needless to say I was able to get into my surgeon that day . The second time I got the news was also January 8 , 2010 . I had had a biopsy of my back where I had a compression fracture . My oncologist really did n't think it was cancer given that I had DCIS and had a mastectomy . I was having so much back and hip pain I tried to reschedule the appointment but they insisted I come in . I should have known then . Talk about denial . I had to lie down in the back seat to tolerate the ride . My oncologist was super . He got me started on femera and pain meds immediately . He had me go see the radiation oncologist right then to get started on radiation . It has been quite a ride this past few months but my PET scan in May was almost completely clear and I continue to improve . I am glad the second time I had to hear the news it was face to face . "

The tumor is small , about 6mm , located in the bottom portion of my right breast . I wo n't know the cancer grade until I have surgery and the surgeon checks the lymph nodes . Prior to surgery I have to undergo an MRI of both breasts and a PET/CT scan of the full body . My surgeon wants to make sure that cancer is n't present elsewhere . My surgical options are lumpectomy with radiation or mastectomy with or without reconstruction . I 'm leaning toward bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction at the time of surgery . Once the tumor is removed a sample will be sent off to the Genomic Health Reference Laboratory and rated for the likelihood of recurrence within 10 years of initial diagnosis . This rating will shed light on what kind of chemo would be best if chemo is a part of my treatment -- I guess the examination of the lymph nodes will be a deciding factor . Needless to say , this has been a most frightening experience . I wake up at night to go to the bathroom and find myself thinking , `` You have cancer . '' It 's really hard to believe . I 'm angry in a way because I have a really healthy lifestyle . Non-smoker , not overweight , exercise regularly , balanced diet . And what 's my reward ? Breast cancer . I 'd love to hear from others who 've elected the bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction . My reasoning is that I 'd rather undergo more surgery if it serves as prevention of recurrence .

I 'm hearing people get fantastic results with Jenny Craig - are you following any particular diet ? I 'm surprised you 've lost 12 pounds and ca n't see a difference in your breasts yet - I really want my new foob to be smaller , it 's about 2 sizes larger than my good side . I 'm hoping the weight loss will help - and even more - that it 'll help my stomach look better .

2,FALSE,"I 'm tellin ya mine was so bad that I would go out in the garage to empty the bag ... true story . It would linger and take forever to get out of the bathroom even with the best bathroom spray you could buy . For us with our first colostomy bag we have to burp them from time to time as they build up with gas . One day in the car before we got to our destination I told hubby to roll down all the windows and I would open the bag and let the gas out -LRB- burp the bag -RRB- as we drove along .

I could tell the other people were talking and probably was commenting on how rotten that decaying animal was ... lol Today I have a disposable bag and do n't have that problem .

0,FALSE,"I had a lumpectomy and sential node biopsy in September . The surgery was pretty easy , easier than I expected . My breast was not as sore as my incision under my arm , It stayed sore around a week or so and gradually got better , I think it took me a week or two to be able to sleep on my left side . My cancer was in my left breast . The drain was not too bad . No physical pain , just a pain of having it on your side for a week . I thought it might hurt when it was removed , but I could n't even feel it come out . I took very little pain medicine . I took some the night I came home from the surgery , and maybe the next day or so and did n't need it from then on . I remember holding my breast in the car , and keeping the seat belt away from it because hitting bumps in the road would make it uncomfortable . I was off work two weeks , but probably could have gone back after one . My husband asked me to please stay home another week to make sure I was fully rested before going back to work . I think the surgery and whole cancer thing was just as stressful for him , if not more . It was probably a good idea . Do n't be too alarmed when you take your ace bandage off the first time . My breast was really flat and misshapened . I remember telling my husband I was n't sure it would bounce back , but it does . My nipple was inverted -LRB- which they said was normal -RRB- . It took quite a while for it to come back and my breast still is looking better each month . My doctor said it should start to get its contour back .

5,TRUE,"Hi all , I 'll be joining you on the January 2008 chemo train . Not looking forward to the potential side effects of chemo and radiation , but am ready to just get this party started .

2,FALSE,"This is probably a silly question but here it goes ... Am I right in saying that , before menopause , your estrogen levels are relatively high and that , once you start/finish menopause , the these levels fall ? So that is why many women take an estrogen supplement during and after menopause , right ? So , does that mean that , before menopause , you are more likely to get estrogen dependent bc -LRB- and the percentage will be higher -RRB- and that afterwards , with the estrogen levels having fallen , if you get bc , the rate of estrogen-dependent bc will be less and if it is estrogen dependent , the % will be lower ? I was dx last year with DCIS -LRB- medium & high grade , multicentric -RRB- shortly after my 50th birthday when I was still having regular periods . Since then I have had eratic periods and have only had one light one in 8 months . A blood test last week confirmed that I am menopausal . My bc was 84 % for estrogen . Does that mean that , now that I have less estrogen in my body , there is less chance of getting a new primary bc in my remaining breast ? I hope this all makes sense ! "
6,TRUE,"Hi Marcia , Thanks for the kind words . Like Paula , I 'm done , procedure-wise . I was able to have lumpectomies , despite having bilateral b/c -LRB- and one of them ILC -RRB- and that 's what I chose .

Herceptin and the AI 's are both great additions to the ` arsenal ' - but they definitely come with more SE 's for many women . I think our doctors - even the best ones , and I love all of mine - often focus our attention on the possiblities and positive outcomes of any procedure or drug , and we learn the down side as we go . Maybe it needs to be that way ... maybe they think we 'd never try anything !

0,TRUE,"I am diagnosed with PTSD and a panic disorder from childhood abuse . i was very stable on meds for about a decade until after I had my first chemo . I had a terrible reaction to the Taxotere , but I donot think that is all that was involved . After chemo , I was put on prednisone which sends me into orbit and into panic attacks . But even off of the steroid , I found I was having unusual panic for me at my stage of recovery in mental health . I have been sober over 21 years -LRB- not a brag -RRB- and after the first chemo , I felt as though I was ` brain damaged . '' I only know the feeling because I had a lot of panic -LRB- like thru the roof -RRB- in early sobriety . My brain simply couldnot function , nor could it after the chemo . I had very little impulse control and too much fatigue to deal with anything . I found all of my emotions to be extremely raw and the anxiety was awful . For me , the chemo and its effects , triggered old feelings and emotions and I could notmuster the emotional , physical or spiritual resources to contend with the post chemo brain trauma . I had to switch anti-anxiety meds from klonopin to lorazepam . Therapy was of no use to me if I could not function well enough to get to my therapist . i had to wait until I was a little more stable on the new medications tobegin to work on the PTSD again -LRB- PTSD for me flairs up under stress and cancer is the most stressful event I can think of -RRB- . I thought I would be able tojumpright backintomy daily activities after the chemo becasue that is what the doctor toldme would happen . Boy was he ever wrong . And six weeks after the first chemo , he continues to be wrong . I have to keep my day very simple ; I have to set time aside for rest ; I have to have proper nutrition -LRB- caffiene and sugar is a no-no for me -RRB- and ; I am having to use all of the tools I used in early sobriety to try and ` stabilize ' myself at a bio/psycho/social level . In short , no intense events going on for me -LRB- in a perfect world -RRB- . And I truly have to vent a lot either here on the Board or with trusted friends who have been thru cancer and are further down the road than I am . Lastly , I had to learn how to breathe again and push myself to do daily exercise -LRB- like a walk to the mail box on some days-best I can do -RRB- . I also curb my activities and try not to set myself up for failure . I do not know how women go back to work right after chemo . Grocery shopping may be allI can do one day with laundry the next . My house still looks like a dumpster with windows on it . Today is the first day I manage to clean the house a bit but I am paying for it in very sore muscles tonight . The one thing I am not doing well is getting enough sleep-because I am posting on the Board at 2 AM or something like that-errrgh . Good luck my dear , SV "

Now that the incisions have healed I wear anything that is n't too tight ... still no bra . I asked my PS how I would know when I was the size I wanted , -LRB- I would like to be the size I was before -RRB- , he said for me to bring in a bra that I wore before the mastectomy .

My hubby ordered me some beautiful bras from Victoria 's Secret the other day . I kept thinking ... `` they probably wo n't fit '' ... but it seemed to make him feel good ... a true sign that we were getting the `` girls '' back again . So I decided that if it made us feel happy and helped us believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel than ordering the bras is a good thing ... even if they do n't work out later .

Also before I went did another self check & found another ity bity lump in left breast at 12 o'clock on chest wall up high , this one hurts . She also felt that one too . She went over the Biopsy report from BS w/me , what he said was that the spot of micro cals that he could not biop was at or near the chest wall appearing to be under the arm pit ... .

I love being outdoors and I have had to be careful before surgery not to get sick and now I have to make sure I stay health to heal . I talked to a friend last night who had bilateral DIEP and she is very happy with her breasts . I am very pleased with my new breast , I had skin sparing so the majority of the breast is my orginal skin . When I look at my breast I do n't think of it as not being mine . My husband is very happy with the result . My new nipple looks perfect . Skin is warm and dry to touch and the new nip is nice and pink !!! I 'll keep you in the loop on that first ride . Pam "
4,TRUE,"Hi Mlvaughan - welcome to the club that none of us wanted to join . I 'm sorry about your dx and the unprofessionalism of your doctor . Definitely get a second opinion - and also ask for a second opinion on the Pathology report . My doctor would n't do ANY surgery on me at all without a second opinion on the pathology report . Even if it takes another week , do it . Actually - when you find another doctor , as him what pathology lab he prefers to use and have he order the biopsy tissue samples sent there . Better be safe than sorry ! You sound like a smart woman - so stay calm , do your research -LRB- this web site has TONS of information -RRB- and if you need our help , feel free to ask ! We 're all on the same roller-coaster ride together -LRB- want to sit in the front seat with me ? -RRB- Hugs and best wishes ! "
2,FALSE,"Leggy , this is so horrible hearing about your pain . Certainly there is some medications that can help ? I hope so . I went to my Surgeon following ultra sound and he said it was seroma . I thought he would just syringe the fluid out but he gave me some pills and a local and installed a dang Jackson Pratt drain . Oh , what a pain those are . I have had many of them but have not had to go to work with one before . Not a lot of clothes you can wear with an abdominal drain . Next week is oncologist appt . I always get nervous with those , and then following week is with gyno/surgeon . I also hope this drain can come out next week . Hope everyone is having a good weekend . I bought this really nice wrap around the neck massage and heat unit . It is so nice as I still have shoulder/clavical pain from radiation . Best $ 30 I have spent in a long time . Well , we are going to call in pizza tonight and watch baseball series game 3 I guess . Chocolate ... hope you are doing better on the eating end of things and am sorry to hear of your nerve damage in arm too . Is it same arm as the LE is in ? Hope Deisel is still got some puppy play in him . Wyoming , hope you are doing ok too ... Hi Karen and Bonnie ... hope you two are at least doing OK . Kelly , are you taking your daughter out trick or treating ? Have you got your porch all decorated up for halloween . We do n't have hardly any kids anymore . People just do n't come around anymore .

0,TRUE,"Sumby , we are almost in similar situations with this BC . My doctors are going so slow with me . I was diagnosed in December and had MX in March . I had lymphs involved then had to go back for auxiliary dissection . I was suppose to start chemo this week , but they want and okay from my Rheumatologist , and PCP . My HER 2 was positive from one lab and the other said questionable it was 2.4 which ONC said it 's positive . Being ER + means that they usually give you Arimidex or Letrozole which is a hormone receptive chemo -LRB- I hope I 'm getting this right -RRB- PR + is progesterone but I think the chemo 's I mentioned are used for them -LRB- If not if anyone can tell us that would be great -RRB- . From many women on this board and 2009 Sisters , many are given Tamoxifen , some are able to tolerate this well others are not . My doctors say I ca n't take it because of blood clots and joint pain that can come from it . So I will be taking Cytoxan and probably Letrozoloe , and Herceptin -LRB- Not sure of the spelling -RRB- for the HER2 + . I must say I 'm nervous about it all . Next week they will put in the surgical port . If I 'm cleared to go then I will start Chemo next week also .

It has helped me put this all in perspective . I continue to refer back to it when I do get a bit down but it truely has helped me put it into mind-sized bites . I have an almost identical diagnosis as you and I am looking at it as I have one really sick breast and a few very sick lymph nodes but the rest of me is extremely healthy . We can get through this . Look at this next step of chemotherapy as `` what it is going to do for me not to me '' !! That 's a quote from the book .

It has red bumps which come to a head like a pimple and then turn into sunburn like blisters . Today , Mr. Personality , my rad onc finally agreed that it was a little irritated . Perhaps he thinks that if he minimizes my distress it will diminish . I have decided that no matter what i tell them , the same treatment will continue . This just has to be something that I will get through . It is a kind of Grin and Bear it . RE only rads . I admit to being jealous of those who have `` only rads '' . But then I stop mysefl and think , what is the worst part of this disease it is the fears that it engenders . There are so many people , including me a year ago , that really do n't understand all the nasties about bc . It is a chance to educate others . My education re lymphedema was a booklet given me by surgeon . She also gave me pretty pink booklets on , surgery , reconstruction , chemotherapy and radiation therapy . That is n't enough when one is crazy with fears and `` what if 's '' . To be perfectly honest I find rads much more difficult than chemo . Perhaps that is because it is at the end of a long road of treatment . To those of you just beginning , keept the lotion coming . I have been told three times a day whether it looks red or not . Somedays I put it on four times if the area needs cooling . I wish all you a safe recovery and a easy treatment . "

The most comforting thing -LRB- which I learned through trial and error -RRB- is let her express her anger , or devastion or what ever it is she is feeling , or she will close down and feel very lonely even though you are there for her . I feel it is imperative to allow our sisters to feel what they feel , hug her , cry with her , and most definetly cellebrate the good days she will have , they may be few and far between . Let her know you are there for her anytime day and night , and just listen to her , really listen . When she was first DX I was determined to always be positve , encourage her , I would say things like '' you have to be strong '' '' It could be a lot worse '' I am so proud of you '' '' you look great , your head is so cute '' !!!! Boy was I wrong , aqauintenses say thoe things , waht sheneeded from me to say was '' your right this sucks '' she needed me to cry with her , it justifies their feelings , when she needs to be alone I leave her alone , when she needs to cry we cry , when she is sad I let her know it is ok to be sad , with subtle encouragement . This is a very draining process on siblings if you are close siblings as we are . Ceratinly I do n`t let her see all my pain and sadness I feel everryday , I do n`t let her see my devastation becasue I do n`t want her to worry about me . Just be her sister , you are the one she should n`t have to put on airs for , there will be so many people around her that she has to do that with , be her soft cushion she can fall on , love her with all your heart , be always gentle with her . My sister thanks me for just allowing her to feel what she feels when she feels it , we were so close before and now I can not even describe to you the strength in our sisterly bond has become , it is WONDERFUL !!!

Both techs examined it very seriously and decided it was glitter ! We all had a good laugh which was good . I had asked a friend of mine to accompany my to my visit with the rad onc today to see if I was nuts about the way he treated me . She brought a tape recorder with her . It was like night and day . The nurse spent about five minutes examining me . My friend asked a lot of questions and was told that everything was typical . I had told the nurse that I did n't want to go into the exam room because the hospital was charging me $ 153 each time the doc entered and dismissed me . She said I would have to take it up with the doctor . For the first time he examined me , and he did it carefully . Then he asked if I was using the cream for the scar area . I said yes . Then he said that the good news was that I only had four more treatments and then I would have the boosts . He then asked if I had any questions or comments . -LRB- First time -RRB- . I told him I was concerned about not being informed about the bolus or about being radiated on my back and discovering this in the treatment room I asked him directly if there were any more surprises awaiting me . He said , no except for additional markers for the boost . He explained that the boosts were electrons rather than neutrons and so they did n't penetrate as deeply and did a nice job on the scar . I then asked about the $ 153 charge for the room . He said they were n't doing that . He said that the software on their computer did n't know what to do with some charge so they put it in that category . I said I would take it up with the hospital . After we left the cancer center my friend and I stood in the pouring rain and my friend said wow does your demeanor change when you walk out of the building . I said that is because I hate it there and just grit my teeth and do it . Sunee your son is darling and so are you ! Cute shrek cake . I have a friend that swears by curcumin .

Just follow their instructions . If I may comment about the Ki67 marker issue : it 's always scary to hear one 's marker , such as Ki67 is elevated . In your case Liz , I believe your level was 11 or 20 ; please understand that the range of positivity goes from low to high , somewhere around 10 % to 25 % IHC + -LRB- immunohistochemical stain -RRB- considered low positive to 26 % to 85 % considered high . Secondly , there is always inter-observer variability : what one pathologist to another reads and which may vary the result a few percentage points . A possible reference for you to look at is here : http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v13/n8/full/3880149a.html Putting your situation in a positive light , and your oncologist of course is the true expert , I see a consistency in your low grade tumor , very low mitotic rate -LRB- which is also a reflection of the degree of cell proliferation in the M phase or metaphase , the period of lining up of the cell 's chromosomes -RRB- and your Ki67 range which I seem to recall is below 25 % . In sum , Ki-67 is found not to be a tumor marker on which decisions regarding chemotherapy should be made . Oncotype DX and Mammoprint gene analysis are more prognosticators in this regard . Having been given chemotherapy as you were Liz , and now hormonal therapy , it 's reasonable to think that regardless of your Ki-67 value -LRB- one of many pieces to a puzzle -RRB- , you kicked your cancer 's #u ** .

0,TRUE,"It is a very personal decision . NYCarol makes a good point . Part of the reason I decided against chemo was that the doctor reminded me of a couple of things . One , that chemo does n't cut your risk completely , it lowers it by a certain percent and two , that you should weigh the percent of lowering risks against the chance that you will have a serious side effect . For my situation , the oncologist felt that the difference between the benefits of chemo -LRB- about 3 % -RRB- and the chance of getting a secondary cancer or heart disease -LRB- 2 % -RRB- was about 1 - 2 % and was n't worth the chemo so he recommended against it . That combined with the uncertainty of its benefits in the intermediate Oncotype DX range helped me make the decision for me .

All my chemo has been accompanied by a day 3 bottom . I too picked Thursday so I could crash on Saturday and recover on Sunday . SEs have been manageable , although I hate the weight gain , the searching for something to satisfy the taste issues is true for me too ! I think food tastes like a small nugget is wrapped in a huge wad of wax ! Definitely gross . I did my rads for my bone met -LRB- yes , just one rib with cancer -RRB- over 13 treatments while getting my Taxol/Herceptin and it fatigued me a bit more than I expected . Lucky me has a job that will let me work out of the house , so I only made it to work twice in the past 5 weeks -LRB- it is an hour commute each way which seems hardly worth it when I am tired , which is amost always -RRB- . I think the steroids have made my face a perfect circle with a double chin ... lol . I am so glad there is light at the end of the tunnel nearing the end of the chemo meds . I will still have to have weekly Herceptin until I 've completed a year , but I am told that alone Herceptin is a breeze . It will be time to focus on my running and wait until spring when they can check the bone and hopefully I 'll meet NED , every Stage IV girls dream . Meanwhile I 'm busy checking every little bit of hair growth on my still bald looking but covered with white peachfuzz head ! "
0,TRUE,"Hi Girls , Well start rads tomorrow and have to keep tape and b-b 's on until Mon. or Tue. . Could n't get mammo cause of b-b 's and tape . I have a great road map on my chest in case I get lost . Thats possible anymore . My Surg . put tracers in my boop so it did n't take long , about a half hour to map it out . Boy I bet I will set off the metal detector at the airport for sure . I went shopping and picked up a few x-mas things so did n't get home until 6 or so . Met my daughter and had lunch with her.My tongue is really getting bad so if its no better tomorrow gon na see the onky.Broke my cell , it just popped and now I have to hold it together to talk . Thats convenient , its a flip . I will go tomorrow and see if I can find a way to get a phone cheap.I wo n't but I will try . Well I did the Wendys work out tonight . I used my calf muscle to work the gas peddle to drive to Wendys and I did range-of-motion while stearing -LRB- lot of turns -RRB- . I also did the pay to walk today . I walked around the Mall and paid for things I do n't really need . I think I have had a good work out.I bet those lbs . are just melting . Boy those new Hershey 's kisses with carmel are freeking good . I have to limit myself . And I wonder why I am blowing up ? With my memory lately I 'll hopefully forget I have gained . Hope we all can dress and remember our hair tomorrow . I forgot my mother-in-law was having a stint put in yesterday -LRB- heart -RRB- . Shes fine but I feel kinda bad . I always take her and this is the first time I did n't so she should of reminded me . Its an easy process and seldom any complications . -LRB- out pt . -RRB- Hope you all find relief from your side affects for a while . I too never slept all night I was up to pee and get a drink or watch some t.v. but slept more than now . I use to sleep all night until the change knocked at my door . I have my Do-Rag under my ball cap so I stay warm and it hides the gap in the back and hangs down so you ca n't see any stubble . Well I have to be at work at 9 and its 9:02 later Hugs , Mary . "
0,TRUE,"After one month of waiting since my diagnosis , I 'm having a unilateral mastectomy on Monday . It 's my right breast . I 'm more sad and anxious than scared .

2,TRUE,"I was also treated back in 1997 w/lumpectomy and rads for DCIS . Tamoxifen was not prescribed . 10 years later this new , tiny infiltrating pops up . I 'm beginning to wonder about something I read back 10 years ago about early bc . That was early stage 0 or stage 1 bc that is completely excised and treated w/rads has a 9 to 10 year time frame to possible recurrence . I read the article 10 years ago and I ca n't begin to remember who wrote it , but it is interesting how many of the very early bc 's that were treated this way manage to recur - also as early stage bc - 10 years later . Again , the treatment course depends on the first treatment . If you went for breast conservation the first time , then it 's mastectomy no rads the second time . Size had great relevance then in determining whether chemo would follow or not . Now , this new oncotypedx test sheds light on predictor of recurrence in 10 years - this time distant - and whether or not to pursue chemo regardless of size . I am being told distinctly no chemo . So all the talk about the 5 year mark I 'm beginning to wonder about . I 'm beginning to wonder if early bc can be thought of as a chronic possibility that extends beyond the 5 year mark rather than a `` cured '' condition . I mean this for early , small , hormone positive bc 's , stage 0 or 1 and no nodes . I 'm going to bring all this up at my next visit - and I will bring back what I 've learned . Also , I 'd be grateful for any knowledge of legitimate natural aids or specific dietary guidelines to reduce estrogen in the body . Thank you ! "

2,FALSE,"Hi Red RAd girls ! What a great group we have . I am so thankful I have found you all . Barb , the techs told me today that the doc would come in and scribble -LRB- mark -RRB- on me tomorrow so that they could do recalculations and construct some shields out of lead so they could direct the beam into a smaller area . I will let you know how it goes . Today was an interesting experience . I broke the machine . I was lying there doing my usual exposition of skin and scar . The machine zapped me well from directly overhead and then chugged around to do its usually thing on my back.ZAP / Then the techs came in and asked if I could hold the position for five more minutes . I said no prob and grooved into the Christmas music , Then one of them came in and made a bunch on dots on me with his Sharpie marker and then helped me up . They said one of the motors had broken but they would be fixing it and to wait around . So they wrapped me in a warm blanket and I wandered out to hall . One of the techs followed me and explained that within the lense there were 120 leaves of lead . sixty on each side which were controlled separately by a tiny motor for each one . One of the motors broke . About five minutes later they escorted me into the treatment room again and they did the one side zap and the machine chugged around and did the final one on the other side . At least it broke the monotony of the treatments . They said it happens about once a month . Week # 3 and # 4 are when the burns started for me , but everyone is different . I do n't have a boob , just very uneven skin and scars -LRB- four surgeries -RRB- . Lisa , tapes sound like a good idea , but it was n't my idea . My mind is too goofy to learn anything at this stage . As long as I can find my way to and from treatment I am happy . Yesterday I had to go to the dentist after treatment and it was dark when I left the office . I sat in the car for five minutes trying to remember how to turn the lights on . SAD or what ? I have totally forgotton how to play the CD player so all I get is my FM radio . I happy with that . When my son visits in a couple of weeks i will ask him to teach me how to do it again .

It has not been an easy road , what with the expansion process and muscle aches/spasms . I still would not have chosen a different path , though . Been there , done that , with the lumpectomies .

I was going to go to my hair guy but too lazy and figure I would rather be out a couple dollars if it do n't take as 40 so It looks o.k. in the dim light . Last time I tried it did n't do a thing . Janie my legs have been a dancing around ever since I stopped chemo back in Oct. . They never did jump until I stopped and they have been jumping ever since . My arms even jumped after she pushed it . I felt like I was possessed . Thank goodness everyone else was sleeping or they would of been scared of me . Janie my kids have traveled a lot more than me too . There was spring break and road trips with friends and ol mom just stayed at home and worked . I have only been to Chi . twice or 3 times . My hubby and I do n't know our way around and my sister does but she is n't leaving until late . I guess I did n't learn my lesson after our trip to Memphis and my hubby kept going around in circls . I have a print out from map quest . I made my hubby some curtains for his shed/castle . He loves Jeff Gordan the racer and I got material and made him Jeffy curtains . I am so talented ... I cut the material and ironed the sticky tape on to make a hem and rod pocket and they look good . My dinning room lace insets are done the same way . I have n't figured out how to wash them so they do n't fall apart yet . I can sew but I hate to . I will never have another sewing machine and I keep thinking about it but I have to fight the urge . Its too time consuming . I have to do the seams and everything perfect and I drive myself nuts !!!! The iron on sticky stuff works great for small jobs . Well tomorrow will be another `` Quest '' for our destination . I will read the map instructions and hubby will drive and make a wrong turn or miss a turn and we will drive for miles before we decide to stop and just admit we are lost . Maybe if they put beautiful girls pictures on the turning points on the map men could follow directions . For my hubby it would have to be tools , turn at the power saw and continue to the screwdriver , go a 2 inch nail past the exit and make a left onto the right side of the pliers . Yea , he could follow that , or the girls . Well I will let you know if I talk to anyone from the other side . Do n't know what to expect but it should be interesting . Good night , Mary "
6,FALSE,"Hi Nicki , sent you a pm also . More than a bit bummed about Bev . I have been MIA of late and it kind a started after Bev gave us the news of mets . I think part of it was my fear for her , part of it my fatigue and just being darn busy . Also this is a gray time of year and so does my mood turn gray . Ca n't say that I am worse than normal but am coping by dropping out of some stuff that can make me sad . On a positive side son 's sports are going great and his academics are holding . He is always on the edge but I think he will manage and in that I hope in a positive fashion . He informed me he would not go out for track and I think it gave him motivation and direction in the spring for school . His track coach tried to tell him that with very little effort he could be great but alas it is very hard to motivate him to do anything he has little interest . I hope some good lookig girl goes out and he wants to impress her . My end would be motivation from the sport to do will in school to stay eligible . Moms do not always get what they want out of their kids but I will never lose HOPE about everything and anything . As for boat , names are still being tossed around -LRB- hope boat never gets tossed around ! -RRB- and leading the name game is `` La Boat Blue '' after my hubby 's favorite brew `` LaBatt Blue '' Canadians in heart and soul if not in geographic location . Since the trip to Canada and hockey are so close in our lives , it 's a natural fit . I remember the first time in Canada restuarant my hubby being asked if he wanted a domestic brew or import and we got a good case of the giggles hearing his fav was domestic ! We live eat and breath hockey 11 out of 12 months of the year and I worked for a minor hockey league putting myself through college . Again very near and dear to me personally . Still have little health issues and keep finding more but none are insurmontable and expect both of us to do very well for a very very long time . It does make my resolve to get together sooner rather than later even stronger . I do think the time has come for me to make very definitive plans to get together . You have been my inspiration on several accounts and I would like to thank you personally and definitely face to face . I did look at meet in the middle once upon a time and came up I thinkwith like Missouri or something close to that . I need to explore again but if you have any ideas give em up please .

0,TRUE,"Upon my DX and being advised I 'd need a mastectomy , I immediately wanted a bilat , but was told it was not necessary or possible . While going thru chemo , I watched a lot of daytime TV during Oct. , Cancer Awareness Month . Kept seeing women who had proudly gone thru 2 bouts of cancer . I thought : anything I can do to avoid a second recurrence , I would do it . Started researching recurrence rates : I had been monitored for cystic breasts for maybe 6 years previous to DX. , and we knew I had microcalcs , and my breast surgeon told me I 'd likely have trouble down the road , and sure enough , there I was . I had to fight tooth and nail to get t his done . I showed up at my surgeon with an inch thick stack of studies . He finally relented and agreed because of my mental state . Yeah , right , * I 'm * nuts . Whatever . I 'm almost 3 years out , and do n't regret it ONE BIT . It 's a huge relief .

Mina_Bird I agree with Marion ... you have to do everything you can while you can . My Onco score made it very easy for me as it was high middle range . I had a very very small tumor -LRB- 6mm -RRB- but grade 3 . They did not think I would need chemo but score showed something different . So with Chemo and hormones my risk becomes significantly lower . Onco says chemo will really help to ensure that I stay in the good cancer boat as he called it . Only you can decided what to do . Marion how long did it take for your hair to grow back ? Any advice on the whole chemo thing ... I was really hoping to miss it but I have to this so ... off I go !

I love my bosses !!! I had 4 rounds of chemo and am finishing up radiation and for the most part continued to work through treatment .

I made dh go that very same day and got a new puppy , another chocolate lab , which we have still , our Molly .

I remember crying and telling my OH that I could n't do this anymore . Then , I woke up the next day and went to my tx . It was a moment and it passed . Xanax helped too ! When I would feel like this , I would really concentrate on the results of chemo and why I was doing it . Results meaning that it was zapping any left over bad cells . And that was a good thing .

2,TRUE,"Hollyann , I do n't know if you 're `` allowed '' to be here to read , but if you are , then you 're reading these posts for you . All women have different types of relationships . Some have men who can deal with their wife or partner 's breast cancer experience in a supportive way . Others do not . I 've heard my husband complain about the time I 've devoted to my online support , or `` blogs '' as he calls them , or going out with my girlfriends for fun . For me , my online bc sisters are n't blogs . For me , my bc support system has been a lifeline in many ways , and the friendships have grown beyond the topic of breast cancer . But deep down , a shared experience with breast cancer is always the common denominator , a more empathetic support than that of even the best of friends who have n't had it . Would n't it be great to have a seal of wellness , like the good housekeeping seal of approval ? Well , in the meantime , it 's been proven that women with support groups have less liklihood of breast cancer recurrence than those who do not . I do n't have a link to give you , but if you google support systems for breast cancer survivors and better survival , you 'll see . Would he mind if you kept in touch with your bc sisters just to do all you possibly can for your health , because there is truth to the mind/body connection . I think our men really just want life to return to their own normal eventually . They get weary . This must be why we 're the stronger sex . I can not imagine my own husband dealing with all the things women take in stride - let alone breast cancer . If the man ca n't be strong enough to support you when you need it - to give you that lift when you need it - to give you the light of day when things are feeling dark , then you must do for you what you would tell your own daughter or best friends to do . You 're of more help to those around you when your own mind is at ease , than if you are an unsupported ball of worry . Just do n't forget yourself in the effort to please a man . ~ hanna "

I died it tonight and it looks as if its kinda brown . May be different in the light . I had so many colors going on so it may look like a zebra . I was going to go to my hair guy but too lazy and figure I would rather be out a couple dollars if it do n't take as 40 so It looks o.k. in the dim light . Last time I tried it did n't do a thing . Janie my legs have been a dancing around ever since I stopped chemo back in Oct. . They never did jump until I stopped and they have been jumping ever since . My arms even jumped after she pushed it . I felt like I was possessed . Thank goodness everyone else was sleeping or they would of been scared of me . Janie my kids have traveled a lot more than me too . There was spring break and road trips with friends and ol mom just stayed at home and worked . I have only been to Chi . twice or 3 times . My hubby and I do n't know our way around and my sister does but she is n't leaving until late . I guess I did n't learn my lesson after our trip to Memphis and my hubby kept going around in circls . I have a print out from map quest . I made my hubby some curtains for his shed/castle . He loves Jeff Gordan the racer and I got material and made him Jeffy curtains . I am so talented ... I cut the material and ironed the sticky tape on to make a hem and rod pocket and they look good . My dinning room lace insets are done the same way . I have n't figured out how to wash them so they do n't fall apart yet . I can sew but I hate to . I will never have another sewing machine and I keep thinking about it but I have to fight the urge . Its too time consuming . I have to do the seams and everything perfect and I drive myself nuts !!!! The iron on sticky stuff works great for small jobs . Well tomorrow will be another `` Quest '' for our destination . I will read the map instructions and hubby will drive and make a wrong turn or miss a turn and we will drive for miles before we decide to stop and just admit we are lost . Maybe if they put beautiful girls pictures on the turning points on the map men could follow directions . For my hubby it would have to be tools , turn at the power saw and continue to the screwdriver , go a 2 inch nail past the exit and make a left onto the right side of the pliers . Yea , he could follow that , or the girls . Well I will let you know if I talk to anyone from the other side . Do n't know what to expect but it should be interesting . Good night , Mary "
0,TRUE,"Something new to ponder.Last week I felt a lump very near where the other 3 tumors were . I was n't to see the onc til Fri. so I went to family Dr. and she felt it and sent me for a ultra sound and it showed nothing . I did have onc . check it out Fri. at my chemo appointment and she said I need to have the surgeon check it out . I am going to wait til the last chemo Dec. 2nd to see him because he is an hour and a half away . I guess after I had the ultra sound results I was n't worried but after seeing the onc . she seamed a little concerned . Do you even think it is possible for a tumor to start while your having treatment ? That does n't seam possible . But when you think about it why is it more likely to show up in the first 2-3 years after treatment then later down the road . Do n't you think that should be the other way around , like you should be more protected in the 1st few years after tx ? Idk seams strange to me and hopefully if it nothing . It sure does scare you to feel something else . "
2,TRUE,"Hello Sueps , I am sorry to hear your biopsy revealed breast cancer last Monday . The women and men here on this forum will offer you much help as you undergo surgery and other treatment as necessary . Do you know why your surgeon is proceeding to mastectomy ? Has he or she informed you about lumpectomy and sentinel node testing -LRB- the first node in the lymph node chain often identified as either negative or positive -RRB- ? Are you going to your visits alone or with a family member , so another may also hear what your surgeon is saying ? Maybe you wish to set up another surgeon visit to review your plan with him or her again . Regrettably , most breast cancer are present for many months/years before typically being diagnosed , so in light of this , it is not uncommon for surgery to be set up two to three weeks hence . It all varies , and depends on the surgeon and the hospital . Perhaps you could ask your surgeon to put you on standby in the event a hospital time slot opens ; sometimes Saturday mornings are options . It is so hard to wait four weeks , and no one wishes this for you , yet sometimes it 's the best the system offers . Intermediate grade means that under the microscope , the pathologist feels the cells look medium in their change from normal breast ductal cells . This category falls between low grade , where the cells are called well differentiated and most resemble normal breast ductal cells , and high grade where the cells are more different from the normal ductal cells . So , you fall right in the middle , where many of us do . It will help you some to find out if your cancer carries estrogen and/or progesterone receptors . That will give all an idea whether hormones will be part of your treatment plan . They can run this test on your biopsy material . If your surgeon is not a great communicator , and you and your family have questions , why not go for a second opinion from a second breast cancer surgeon ? You need to have a clear understanding why a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy is n't the first step . Others will soon respond also . I 'll be thinking of you during the next weeks , remembering all to well the fear associated with my own breast cancer diagnosis . I did not have the benefit of this board , so good on you for finding it so soon . < bredit : > "

4,TRUE,Morning everyone ! Just checking in to see how it 's going with you all . Sounds like there is positive notes but as the rest of this roller coaster ride has been still the sudden shocks . I 'm feeling better and my skin is feeling lots better . Saw my radiation onc this week and all is going good - do n't go back for 6 months to see him . I 'm on my second month of the tamoxifen - some hot flashes and joint pain but not too bad . I am working full time with a little over time which wipes me out but need the extra money now so ... I just try to rest more when I 'm tired . I am also looking forward to thanksgiving as I feel I have so much to be thankful for this year especially ! My children and grandchildren are all supposed to be here so that will be great ! You are all still in my thoughts and prayers ! Carole

2,TRUE,"Well my radiologist has me scheduled for a follow up to my PET scan in January ! So I called and asked if the news was good ... i mean why would he wait till January ? And he said it was good news . The scan results were NORMAL . And it was a whole body scan , so Yahoo! So I will be seeing the onc about the lump and determine what it is and what treatment for it if its from radiation or something else . I have that appointment scheduled on Nov 12 . So last night was my first night of good sleep and good dreams and even though it rained today , I watched the leaves fall and did wash and cooked and felt extremely happy that I am out of the end of the tunnel and into the recovery light . Praise God , boy did I lean on God . The lump seems to change in size , even though it is hard , it could be a lymph node . Today it is much smaller than a few days ago when i got the boosts . Maybe it is related . The radiologist said it could be related to the rads . "
1,TRUE,"I almost posted this same kind of question myself recently . I have lost my ability to concentrate and find myself forgetting what I was saying , or ending up saying the wrong words etc. . I am three years from diagnosis now and yet I can not seem to type straight , get all my letters in the wrong spot and lose my train of thought documenting files at work and have to keep rereading what I have already wrote and start over . When trying to study or read books I keep reading the same paragraph over and over again trying to get it to sink in what I just read . My grown daughters even made an intervention call saying that they were worried about my memory and were worried something was terribly wrong . I finally even went to see my doctor about it . He said it was normal due to age , hormones and the fact that I am burning the candle at both ends . I work full time days and go to the University full time nights ... He went ahead and ordered a brain scan just to be safe but it was clear . Although chemo put me into menopause for 1ξ1/2 years my cycles returned and the doctor said at age 48 it is normal perimenopausal issues that are messing with my mind . I even saw a counselor about the problem since I even got concerned enough to think maybe it was due to depression or some other kind of underlying mental health issue . She also said she thinks that I am just fine and said that she thinks the problem is that I never gave myself a chance to rest and heal from all the BC treatment trauma since I kept working and then started back to school again right after wards . So I got lots of reassurance that it is normal and that I am just fine . But it still does not change the fact that I am having to deal with this problem on a regular basis and it is effecting my ability to work and study . I feel like I am never settled if that makes any sense and I do wonder if having gone through this experience is at the root of that . I have a lot to be grateful though , so I just try to focus on that and come up with some ways to try to focus better but it is still frustrating and worrisome "

0,TRUE,Linda I came home today from hospital surgery went well . I got those last two drains out and boy were you right I feel so much better with those out . I hope I am finally on the right road to recovery . It has been a long road and stil a little ways to go but feel very confident everything will be good from here on out . -LRB- with alot of luck -RRB- No I am very positive that everything is going to be good till the end . You have mentioned something about where you wonderful women have posted pictures of the process of your surgeries how do you go about being able to view them ? Right now I do n't know if I 'm going to do nipples or not is that process very difficult ? Just been through so much already do n't know how much more I can take . I have the BEST husband in the world he has been behind me through all of this and has left everything up to me . He told me I did n't have to do reconstruction that was my choose he said he fell in love with me not my breast and that did n't bother him as long as he had me that 's all that mattered .

0,TRUE,"Dear Gayle , We all know realistically that surgeons and oncologists do not have x-ray eyes.The only way to know for sure that there are no bad cells anywhere is to do a total mastectomy . You have just done that and they have found a tiny metastasis . If you go over all the sites here , that is very common . You will deal with it and then go forward . For each of us , as info about our particular situation was received , we digested il and make decisions towards the road to health . There were never any guarantees that it would be a straight line for any of us . I am happy that your right breast is fine . Most people who have not had a bilateral mastectomy do not know if their right breast is fine . i am having my Phrophylactic bilateral mastectomy and recon on Tues. . I have no guarentee that there will not be some invasive cells found . In fact i have read so much about people finding them , that i will be happily surprised if they are not found . Maybe it is self protection , but life is like that . Also cancer is a tricky SOB . Clear nodes often do not offer absolute assurance that cancer will not return , and 1 or 4 nodes that are not clear , do not always offer a bad prognosis . I would eat some confort foods , if you can , watch a movie or read a good mag or book , and wait before you jump to any conclusions . Remember , in spite of much that you have learned , you do n't know everything . It sounds like you have a good medical team . Now you must have faith -LRB- in the most existential sense -RRB- that you will be OK , and you will , Have a calm weekend and know that this is just a small bump on a winding , bumpy road , that leads to a clearing with blue skies .

6,TRUE,"I have been lurking on this website for the past year and a half . I am a year out from chemo and am now dealing with both fear of recurrence as well as the decision about ovarian suppression . I know there is a hormonal therapy thread , but I thought I 'd post this here since it seems that the recommendation for supression is based on the aggressive nature and staging of my diagnosis . I am 40 years old and had been in chemopause for the past year , but my FSH levels have been declining for the past 3-6 months and at the end of April I had my first period . My skin looks good and I 've been feeling like maybe I could shed the disgusting fat around my belly . I actually desired to have sex for the first time in over a year which was fabulous . BUT ... I had the dreaded ovary discussion with my oncologist today about suppression which he recommends . I am so sad about it . I know I should do everything possible to prevent recurrance .

2,FALSE,"Chemotherapy drugs cause changes in the skin that make it more susceptable to DNA mutations/damage when exposed to the sun/tanning lights .

0,TRUE,"Golfing B , I do n't golf , but I Kayak and hike and such . I had DCIS with micro invasion with cluster cell calcification . Because the radiologist was up on new signs and symptoms , mine was caught early , the year before the radiologist dismissed the same mammogram as normal . I had right mastectomy on 12-29-08 . I had a tissue expander placed the same day -LRB- 200cc 's -RRB- and was so blessed that the pain I was expecting was well managed with short term narcotics and Advil . I still use the Percocet 1/2 tablet along with Advil for about 3 days post `` fills '' at night to help me sleep . I saw the oncologist last Friday the 30th and she said I was `` CURED '' I was told at the time of the biopsy that my cancer was 3 mm in size , after the surgery and pathology , the tumor area was well over an inch in diameter . I think I made the right decision to do the mastectomy , besides my surgeon stated that he felt that I would need a mastectomy down the road anyway because of the noted other area of clustering on the other side of the same breast . Because I did the mastectomy , the cancer is GONE ! The left breast is clean , so I elected to not do a prophylactic mastectomy on that side . I am very small breasted so an inch on my breast may have been a lumpectomy on another woman . I have a great plastic surgeon and you ca n't even tell that I have had a mastectomy unless I am naked ! I just ca n't do Pilates that pull my chest muscles for awhile . If I had to do this all over again , I know I could do it with less fear this time , Just take care of yourself , and do n't rush back into being superwoman , let your body heal as well as your emotions .

0,TRUE,"Great question ! I chose a bilateral w / immediate reconstruction -LRB- expanders/impants -RRB- I had 3 yr old twins and 6 yr old . My first PS -LRB- who eventually did my implants -RRB- recommended a bilateral Pedicle TRAM . When I researched it , I freaked out . I was worried that I would n't be able to hug/pick up/snuggle my kids at a time when they REALLY needed to see that I was -LRB- more or less -RRB- OK . Or maybe I should say , at a time when I really needed to feel like I could still be a valuable Mom -- not just a sick lady . In those first few weeks after dx , I could n't shake the feeling that I might die SOON . I was so scared that I would pass away and my kids either would n't remember me at all , or would only remember a sick person . Plus , I am really active ... horses , skiing , lots of heavy activities which depend on core strength . I wanted reconstruction , but it was VERY , VERY important to me that I physically felt like myself after all was said and done . I could n't believe that with that intense of surgery + mesh , a hip to hip scar , etc that I could possibly stretch/bend/lift / balance without feeling something was weird/tight/restricted . So , in one moment , I 'm planning my funeral and throwing away crap I do n't want my family to find . In the next , I 'm freaking out because I do n't want my reconstruction procedure limiting my skiing or my ability to throw bales of hay out of a pick-up . Major disconnect . I was fixated on DIEP ... kept hearing it was the Gold Standard , yada , yada , yada ... That PS also sent me to a microsurgeon for a consult about MS TRAM . PS # 2 could do whatever procedure he wanted , but somewhere in the conversation agreed that for many young , bilateral patients implant were a great choice . It was as if the sky parted and I realized that I was attracted to DIEP like a moth to flame ... I was just being drawn to bright and shiny things , when what I needed was simplicity . At 55 or 60 , with kids out of the house and the mental room to recover , a flap procedure would have sounded much more attractive . And that free tummy tuck would be all the more welcome .

0,TRUE,"Hi ladies ! I have had a big week . My BMX w/immediate DIEP was on Tuesday -LRB- 5/18 -RRB- and I came home this afternoon - 5/23 . The surgery was really long - @ 12 hours . I was really out of it in post-op and I do n't think I even opened one eye in there - I would slowly answer a question or two . My husband was waiting for me up in my room -LRB- no roommate ! -RRB- and he offered to spend the night and I said just go home , because I was really uncomfortable and so sleepy . I really do n't remember much of that day ! Days 2 and 3 were similar - very painful and I just slept and slept and slept . The nurses had me get out of bed for the 1st time on day # 2 . That just about killed me . I threw up two times after walking . I was wiped out and really felt nauseous . I remembered other people on here writing about getting out of bed for the first time , and I knew it would be important to get moving . So , I just pushed ahead and did it . My nurse called my PS to see if he would prescibe a little patch for nausea - it is placed just a little under the ear . It is effective for 72 hours . It worked great ! I did more walking with each day . The catheter was removed on day # 3 - I could make it into the bathroom by then . The pain was terrible for me , I will not gloss it over . My doctors and nurses tried all sorts of pain killers . Started with morphine , percocet , and other such drugs . I am now on Oxycodon and that is the one that works for me . I do get really tired , but that 's OK . By late yesterday -LRB- day # 4 -RRB- , I was feeling much better and hoping to go home the following day . I left the hospital @ 2:00 p.m. today on day # 5 . I am so happy to be home . There is no rest in the hospital . I needed to be woken every hour to have doppler on my new breasts to check blood flow , and this was increased to every 2 hours on day # 3 and then down to every 4 hours at the end . Plus , there were the checks from the nurses ' aides for vital statistics , the nurses that would administer medications and check in on me and the people who cleaned the room . What a difference it makes to be at home ! My DIEP procedure went very well - I finally was brave enough to look and love what I see . My husband thinks they look and feel great ! They are warm and soft - my own tissue , just from a different location . I increased the size and went from a `` B '' cup to a `` C '' cup . My PS did a fantastic job . My arm movement has not been painful at all and things are going pretty well for me . Thank you , Lord . My BS called me a few days after surgery with the results . I was having the BMX mainly for DCIS -LRB- one place -RRB- on the right breast . She found another spot of DCIS in the right breast and my left breast had something as well - ADH . She said it was good that I had listened to my heart - I truly believe I was guided in this decision from a higher authority ! I have read other stories similar to mine . I am grateful that all turned out well - nothing invasive ! I have a long road ahead of me and I plan to be very lazy ! I do not want to do too much - my goal is complete healing . This is a very long and painful surgery - but my breasts look so wonderful - I am so happy . I am praying for all that have had surgery this month , and for those who have dates coming up . As so many others have said - the waiting is so difficult . But , suddenly , it 's all over and your day is here ! You will get through this . The drains -LRB- I have 3 - 1 in each breast and 1 in my abdomen -RRB- are just as bad as most of you have said on this board . I HATE them - they feel as if they are going to rip free and tear open my skin where they are stitched . Stripping and emptying them are n't that bad - but they are a major nuisance . I feel lucky that I only have 3 of them . Sorry to ramble , but I 'm trying to make the most of my awake times . My friends have been bringing dinner all week for my family and this will continue for the next 3 weeks - awesome ! Be well , ladies , and look forward to your new life - body and soul . "
2,TRUE,"Wyoming , when are you going on vacation ? I thought the end of this month . What is the story on your port ? Did you have to get a new one put in ? Anyway ... I hope you have a great time on vacation . Leggy ... I hope someone lights a fire under the bad egg ... now that I think about it ... is n't that another way to detect a bad egg ... candling ? LOL ! Anyway ... hope it all works out for you . We have summer here now . Our AC is running non stop . We have an older home with a huge attic that is our bedroom/office . It is hard to keep cool up here so we have to run our AC extra hard . I have night sweats to boot so I really like my bedroom cool . Guess it 's a good way to spend money , in my opinion anyway . Hope you are all doing well ! I have appt with PS in a couple of weeks but no onc appt until late October . Guess I am taking a little chance with no blood work for that long , but if I have to have another surgery , I know they will run at least a pre-op blood test . Thinking about ya all . . Hugs ...

4,TRUE,"I am glad you found us , I was just dia on May 6 with DCIS , had a lump removed on may 14 , with no clear margins , told It would be best to have a Mast on that breast , I read researched , etc. . there is no right and wrong . I decided to do a bi-lateral Mast , I had to fight to get this done on the healthy breast that had 3 large cysts already , I could for see my life every 3 months with mamo 's and ultrasounds . It was not for me , so in less that 30 days from diag test results . I decided to have a Bilat - Mast . This was done on 6/3 , I had a few mishaps in the hosp , but I am fine . I will see my GP 6/10 . for more path results and my oncol . and my PS on 6/12 . My PS saw me on 6/5 and said I was healing great . I am wearing expanders and will have silicone gel implants when I get to my old size 34-C or D . It was a very fast education and wild ride . But I am glad and hope it is out of my body . If I need further treatment I will do what is needed . So far nothing in my nodes but it was in really bad in my right breast . Every one is different but I do not think I would have known what I know now , changed my mind on surgeries and would be recovering so well if I had not met this wonderful ladies and support group we have here . If I can help anyone Please send me a PM and we will talk on the phone if you want more infor or just some moral support . I want to help others and they helped me . God bless and love to you all .

5,TRUE,Hey lifeline59 - I am on 10 Xeloda per day . 5 in the am and 5 in the pm . I chase the xeloda with a nasea pill - ondanestron . I have n't had any nasea . I have had some food aversion . I am also on the flat tastebud train . I read somewhere that if you suck on ice during your infusion that that helps the taste buds stay alive . Maybe a wifestale but I 'm going to try it . I am on my 3rd infusion starting tommorrow . LoriFL - I read your post on being depressed on the Ixempra . I have been more emotional than usual . I am usually boundlessly happy but I have been in the dumps since I got my `` chronic '' diagnosis . I am going to ask the onc tommorow about the depression . Thanks for your questions . They lead me to ask my own .
2,TRUE,"teelee , I am sorry that you have had to join the club that no one wants to be a member of ... but if you have to be here , this is board is a wonderful source of support , information and inspiration ... especially in the early days of diagnosis . This board saved my sanity and calmed alot of fears that I had about treatment especially chemotheraphy . I am 3ξ1/2 years out of diagnosis with IDC -LRB- invasive cancer -RRB- at age 41 in Octoaber 05 , a grade 3 tumour , 4 cm and spread to 3 lymph nodes . The reason why I am telling you this is to give you hope that you can survive tis beast . It is tough emotionally hearing the words that you have cancer cause no one believes it can happen to them ... It sounds though like you have an early stage cancer -LRB- DCIS -RRB- like Tender said confined to the breast . Your pathology report will conirm this information and be used to determine further treatment as it will also show tumour size . One thing that was not mentioned was since you are Her2 + herceptin will be used in your treatment plan . I wish you all the best in your treatment . There is light at the end of the tunnel and I am proof that you can come out the other side of treatment and liive a healthly life beyond bc . Michele "
3,TRUE,My Mountain you really hit the nail on the head for me . Being uninhibited and feeling sexy were very tied to my breasts . Mine were not perfect but they were nice and I was very content with them . My DH is also very wonderful but with my current asymmetrical expanders I prefer not to let him see me . Breast cancer and mastectomies are so very cruel and rob us of so much of some of the very spice of life . Thanks Katey for the comment . I will definitiely look on the exchange city thread . Maybe it will encourage me about this whole mess .
0,TRUE,"SA , I havne ' t had the dipe , but 3 years ago I had 3 procedures done at the same time . A gall bladder removal , a 7cm cyst and a D&C . It was relatively quick , in and out in a matter of a few hours after the surgery started really . They used the same incisions plus a new one that had to be expanded for the larger than thought ovary , about 2-3 inches , just above the pubic bone . The others were about 4-5 -LRB- 1/2 -1 inch -RRB- incisions at the belly button , under the ribs in the middle , on the side under the ribcage , and then mid-way between them all . Thankfully they were all above and below where I 'm thinking the diep would be should I decide down the road to go with that . Oh , well , there was the one at the belly button , but I hear that is discarded anyway ... Wonder if that makes one less tied to her mother ! :D J/K , but ... I 'm sure you could do them all at once and be over with it quicker if you are in good health . They said it would take 6-8 weeks for recovery and at 6 , I was mowing on the rider , so ... you should be fine ! "

Pickles tasted the same but most everything else sucked the reason I think is sometimes Chemo magnifies the taste of something and thats why mashed potatoes work not to many spices in them and also Fried potatoes were a godsend to me . I would stay away from my favorites for awhile but , will tell you that now I can drink or eat anything like before Chemo . "
6,TRUE,"Hi ! I 'm new here and was just looking around when I found this topic . Yes , my doctor said that my breast cancer was caused from stress . I was in about the same boat you were in .

I did n't find out I had cancer til April of 08 and he left in Jan of 04 and the doc said when I was diagnosed that by the size of the one in my breast and the fact that it had spread that I had had it for about 4-5 yrs . Amazing huh ? I do n't have any kind of cancer in my family either . So , to answer your question , according to my onchologist and she seems to know what she 's doing ... yes it comes from stress .

0,TRUE,"Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this . I had DIEP reconstruction on my left breast immediately after my mastectomy in March of 2009 . A month later I had surgery to remove the rest of my lymph nodes . This was followed by chemo from April - June . Followed by 8 weeks of rads . My reconstructed breast still has numbness front , top and sides , but underneath I have real discomfort . Sometimes to the point of interrupting sleep . I 've tried going with / without a bra and ca n't find relief . Some days are worse than others . It also feels `` hard '' underneath and it gets pink all over . I 've been back to the plastic surgeon a couple of times . He first suspected infection ; specifically cellulitis . I went on antibiotics for a while . It eventually subsided - but did n't totally clear . Now I am experiencing the pain again . Have n't slept in the past two nights . Other than this `` bump '' in the road , I am feeling well . I go for my first mammogram post-cancer diagnosis on March 3rd . Should I wait to discuss this with her ? So tired of doctors ! Would appreciate any input ... thanks ! "

0,TRUE,"Hi Bev : I had 4 AC treatments three weeks apart prior to Taxol . During that time the tumor shrunk to about 3.5 cm from 6 cm . I was very pleased to actually be able to see it happen . Then , I switched to Taxol every three weeks and the tumor appears to be gone now by palpation anyway . My lymph nodes were swollen also and they have returned to normal too . I did n't have a port since my veins were `` good '' and since I wo n't be getting Herceptin -LRB- HR2 - -RRB- , I elected not to have it . The nurses do believe it 's best to have the port since it 's easier for them and the Adriamycin can do a number on your veins . But I do n't regret my decision . I felt I had enough going on without having to deal with another procedure . You will probably notice a change very early on with the AC . If the tumor stays the same or grows , your onc will probably try something else or send you to surgery . I know my surgeon wanted the mass to be as small as possible prior to operating . I pray you have a good response . It 's worked for many , many others . I 'll be thinking of you as you travel this road . Please keep us informed . "

2,TRUE,"My six month follow-up oncology appt is tomorrow and here I go again wanting to switch from Arimidex to Femara . At my last appt in Jan I asked my oncologist about switching and he said he had no problem with me going on Femara ; however , with his patients the side effects have been worse with Femara than Arimidex and he normally starts off his postmenopausal patients on Arimidex . I have read all the studies on both drugs and I ca n't help but believe that Femara may be the better drug for node positive patients . They have just started a clinical trial called FACE where they compare Arimidex and Femara in node positive early stage breast bc . The results wo n't be out for a number of years -LRB- which wo n't help my decision now -RRB- but Novartis is sponsoring the study -LRB- although an independent company will be doing the trial and gathering the results -RRB- and I ca n't help but believe Novartis believes Femara will be the better drug for postmenopausal node positive early stage hormone receptor positive bc . I am having side effects with Arimidex which include joint/muscle pain , bone loss , mild depression or a better word may be apathy and sleep loss but it is tolerable . I am afraid the side effects will be worse with Femara plus they do not yet know for sure if it is OK to switch between the AI 's although many women are doing just that . My sister took Arimidex for over a year and just could not tolerate the pain and switched to Femara . So far the side effects have been better for her . I was on Tamoxifen for 3 months then had an ooph and then started Arimidex . I have been on Arimidex for a year . Should I stick with it or go with my gut and make the switch to Femara . My last hormone level check showed my estradiol to be at 7 pg which is low but not as low as I had hoped . I know my oncologist is going to think I am wacked when I bring it up again . If there is anyone out there who could shed some light to help me make my decision I would really appreciate it . Sometimes I think I am so anal . I wish I could just accept what my doctors recommend and stop worrying so much about whether I am taking the right drug or having the right treatment . My oncologist is top notch and I am being treated at one of the top cancer centers in the US . Maybe I should just let go and try to move forward with my life and stop worrying so much . Thanks guys for letting me vent . I always get nervous before my follow-up appts and start trying to think of more ways to better reduce my risk of recurrence .

I kept saying to her `` Call them '' -LRB- by this time I had moved back to FL and lived near -RRB- - she said `` oh no - if something is wrong , they will call me '' - guess what - she is one that slipped through the cracks . Something was drastically wrong -LRB- BC mets -RRB- but no one had called to tell her or ask her to come back in - somehow she just got forgotten . I do n't know if she would still be alive if she had n't slipped through the cracks or not but it still angers me . You did n't say how old Mom is but my Mom 's generation were so different - they were so . . almost afraid ... of docs and would never dream of asking questions - it was always `` yes doctor , no doctor '' ... . my generation -LRB- I am 55 -RRB- learned to advocate for ourselves - we ask questions , disagree and do LOTS of research . So , do n't be hard on Mom and be there for her - Dad is probably scared to death too - it is sad but here comes a time when the tables turn - our parents count on us instead of the other way around . Prayers for Mom and let us know how she does . Hugs , Cindie "
6,TRUE,dottie . . I am in same boat DCIS stage 0 after a lumpectomy and 2 rexcisions still one margin went right to skin line . Is all the cancer gone . . they just do n't know . Now I 'm planning a tram flap rebuild and mast and they also want to do a sentinel lymph node extraction . Are they telling you to do this too ?
0,TRUE,"Thanks Flalady for your explanation and answer to my question . I did have bilateral masts 7/21 for this local recurrence and am now trying to decide on chemo - whether to or not to . Right now , just 3 weeks out from the surgery , I know I am not strong enough physically or emotionally to go through chemo . Oncologist has recommended 4 cycles of TC , but having chemo only improves my being free of cancer in 10 years by 6 % . And so I make myself crazy trying to decide ! I have a real problem having chemo for micromets or small cells of cancer that MIGHT be there and am trying to learn what would be the differece in waiting . I mean , if I waited and if mets showed up 3 months or 3 years down the road , I know I 'd have to go through chemo then . If I had chemo now being NED and mets showed up in the future , would the chemo have to be something different and/or stronger ? Decisions ... ... ... . decisions ... ... ... . . "
4,TRUE,"Hi there . I found my lump 3 weeks ago and it 's been a snowball ride and a roller coaster emotional ride ever since . The lump appeared out of nowhere -LRB- it was n't there Saturday and was there Sunday -RRB- Saw the GYN on Tuesday had the mammo and ultrasound on Friday . Saw the breast surgeon the next Wednesday , she said she was afraid it was cancer . Did the biopsy . Got those results last Monday . It is cancer Saw her with my husband on TUesday ... it 's 3-3 .5 cm invasive ... do n't know any more than that . Discussed the options and am having the mastectomy with reconstruction right away . . See the plastic surgeon tomorrow , PET scan on Thursday and pre-op the following Tuesday . Will schedule the surgery after I see the plastic surgeon tomorrow . I feel like my head is spinning . I hold it together at work and around my two little boys and then once they go to bed , I lose my mind a little . I 'm not really sure what feelings I am having as I think they are all running together , I know for sure I 'm scared . . beyond that I 'm not sure . I think I 'm looking right now for support from others in this `` club '' . Thanks so much . . Christy "
4,TRUE,"Robyn-Sorry you find yourself on this web site but I am happy you found it . I was 45 with 5 and 7 year old boys when I was dx in 2006 . I am still here to type this . I know you are scared and it feels like someone just put a bomb off in your head but until you get your test results you will probably feel this way . It is like a roller coaster ride at first . Once you have your results the planning stages will start . Hopefully it is not cancer and life will get back to normal soon . If it turns out to bc it sounds like they will have caught it pretty early . Do n't read to much about it yet . You can scare yourself even more . Come back here for support though . It is a wonderful place and there are so many wise , loving women here to help . "
0,TRUE,"I 'm happy Jule that you posted this question . I 've been taking Arimidex for 9 months now and my bones and muscles are really starting to ache ! I 've always had a little arthritis in my hip - but now I feel like an old woman ! Even the bones in my FEET hurt ! And I 've got such dry skin - and I 'm so tired at the end of the work day , I 'm lucky I do a little laundry . This is NOT living ! I have my last Herceptin infusion on April 22 - so my plan is to wait a couple of months after that - but if these SEs do n't go away , I 'll start a discussion with my onc about getting off Arimidex . I 'm already post-menopausal - and I really want to lose weight , but the way I feel , how can I do any exercise ? I do worry about BC recurrence though - no matter what the statistical calculators say - I feel my body personally has defied statistics ! Online calculators showing my overall risk for getting BC were NOT accurate ! I was at such an extremely low risk - but I got it anyway . So I 'm nervous about risk - about `` rolling the dice '' and losing . So I 'll definitely be talking to my onc down the road - thanks for posting this question ! "
5,TRUE,"Hiya April RADs-I should probably have been here all along , but I joined the March RADS train , and just posted this for a newbie , when one of the gals said I really should post it in April and May RADS ... so if the forums allow me to post all this , here goes ... I hope it helps : "
2,TRUE,"thanks for the hugs , and the prayers , meece . i need them all . . this isnt the first ps , i saw a few before masectomy last yr , and they all agree , with all my health problems i would be foolish to even try any recon . ms would reject it , or id get an opportunistic bacterial infect. , or have another stroke . . so , thats it . it sucks to be me . . but i have gotten this time , and will keep going health wise . its just foolish to worry about cosmetic issues now . the way he put it , i could live from breast cancer , then die from vanity . . i know he 's right , but when i look in the mirror , im horrified ! and it 100x 's better than t was . mine was a ra dical , so , im not just flat , i have indents . . im just praying a lot to accept myself as i find myself right now.your support has helped alot . off for more testing . onco is convinced i have some abdominall/gyn/gi tumour , so im having a pet scan , and an ultrasound . added to the gi scan i prev . had , a colonoscopy , and an endoscopy . they keep finding stuff that chemo did , but the bloat keeps getting larger . something is causing this gas , but they dont know what . . yet . i guess patience is in order . . i never pray for patience , then God gives you times to practice it . so , im prayinf for acceptance , that feels more pallitable , somehow . thanks for checking in for me . ireaaly appreciate it . light and love , cherieaka 3jaysmom "
