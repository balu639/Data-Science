## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. The core idea behind machine learning is to allow machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that learned knowledge.

### Types of Machine learning

#### Supervised Learning
In this approach, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data and their corresponding correct outputs are provided. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by generalizing patterns from the training data. Common tasks in supervised learning include classification (assigning inputs to predefined categories) and regression (predicting continuous values).

Algorithms are 
 * Linear Regression
 * Logistic Regression
 * Decision Trees
 * Random Forest
 * Support Vector Machine(SVM)
 * KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours)

#### Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, and it has to find patterns and structures within the data on its own. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are examples of unsupervised learning tasks.

Algorithms are
 * K-Means Clustering
 * Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

#### Semi-supervised Learning
This is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm is trained on a partially labeled dataset. It uses both labeled and unlabeled data to improve its performance.

#### Reinforcement Learning
In this paradigm, an agent learns to interact with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and it learns to take actions that maximize cumulative reward over time.
