## Numpy
Numpy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides a multidimensional array object, various mathematical functions, and tools for working with arrays. Numpy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning tasks.

### Features

#### 1.N-dimensional arrays: 
The core functionality of Numpy revolves around its ndarray object, which allows efficient storage and manipulation of arrays. Numpy arrays are homogeneous and can be of any dimensionality, making them ideal for representing vectors, matrices, and tensors.
#### 2.Efficient Computation:
Numpy leverages highly optimized C code under the hood, making it significantly faster than regular Python lists for numerical operations. It provides a wide range of functions for array manipulation, mathematical operations, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and more.
#### 3.Broadcasting:
Numpy's broadcasting feature enables element-wise operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes. It eliminates the need for explicit looping and enhances code readability and performance.
#### 4.Integration with Other Libraries:
Numpy seamlessly integrates with other popular Python libraries, such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. This integration allows for efficient data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflows.
#### 5.Array Indexing and Slicing:
Numpy provides powerful indexing and slicing capabilities to access and modify specific elements or subarrays within an array. These operations can be performed using integer or boolean array indexing, as well as using logical conditions.
#### 6.Linear Algebra Operations:
Numpy offers a comprehensive suite of linear algebra functions, including matrix multiplication, matrix factorization, eigenvalue computation, and solving linear systems of equations. These capabilities are crucial for many scientific and engineering applications.
#### 7.Memory Efficiency: 
Numpy arrays are memory-efficient, as they store data in a contiguous block, reducing overhead and allowing efficient memory access. Numpy also provides features for memory-mapped arrays, which enable reading and writing large arrays stored on disk.

## Installation
You can install the numpy package using the following command.  
              ` pip install numpy `   
              
## Usage
Once installed, you can import Numpy in your Python scripts or interactive sessions using the following import statement:  

` import numpy as np `

## Pandas

## Matplotlib
